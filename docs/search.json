    "text": "Overview\nEnteric infections remain the second leading cause of diarrheal morbidity and mortality globally in children, despite significant improvements in access to latrines and safe water sources in high disease burden countries. Our prior research has demonstrated that the “enteric pathome” - i.e. the communities of viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens transmitted by human and animal feces in the environment - ingested by children living in low-income urban neighborhoods of Kenya is taxonomically complex and varies by exposure pathway. Our preliminary data indicates that the risk of multi-pathogen infection is elevated among those 6- month old Kenyan infants fed cow’s milk and living in urban households with dirt floors, shared latrines, and cohabitating domestic animals. This suggests multiple aspects of societal development beyond latrines and water sources are required to reduce complexity in pathogen transmission in high burden countries. We hypothesize that joint modeling of enteric pathome agents across households and neighborhoods that represent contrasts in urban societal development will show that development leads to pathome evolution from complex to simple community structures, and thus lower detection frequencies for individual pathogen taxa.\nUnderstanding the evolution in pathome complexity induced by societal development and subsequently identifying effective intervention strategies is challenging since field experiments are expensive to implement, difficult to generalize to other settings, are only informed by existing, limited observational data, and sufficiently sophisticated statistical and mathematical pathome modeling tools are not currently available. The PATHOME project aims to\n\ndevelop spatiotemporal and trajectory statistical models to understand the complex exposure risks for infants from the enteric pathome,\ncollect environmental, behavioral, spatial, economic, and microbial data to characterize the enteric pathome along pathways for disease diffusion and the intersection of humans and animals with these pathways, and\ndevelop and validate agent-based models (ABMs) for predicting which social and environmental urban developmental interventions (e.g. animal penning, building latrines or drains, concrete floors) best prevent multi-pathogen transmission to infants in high disease burden countries using established Kenyan study sites as a model.\n\nOur interdisciplinary team includes a biostatistician, infectious disease epidemiologists, microbiologist, computational scientist, behavioral researcher, and urban development geographer\n\n\nFunding\nThis work is supported by the National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Center (R01TW011795).\n\n\nStudy record\nThe PATHOME project can be found on clinicaltrials.gov."

    "text": "Pathogen Transmission and Health Outcome Models of Enteric Disease\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nRATIONALE\n\n\n\n\nRecruit from neighborhoods representing low to moderate levels of societal development to test counterfactual hypotheses that high thresholds of basic development can reduce pathogen transmission.\nThe rapid growth in middle-class urban households in LMICs globally can be leveraged to compare enteric pathogen exposure and health patterns across a socioeconomic developmental spectrum to identify the conditions that most influence enteric disease transmission. While increases in household socioeconomic status are known to decrease the risk of pediatric diarrhea in LMICs, most studies have been based in low-income populations. Evidence from middle class neighborhoods testing are critical for identifying tipping points in transmission and accurately predicting potential program impact on health outcomes.\n\n\nApply a One Health approach that includes zoonotic and environmental health to identify all sources of pathogen transmission.\nDomestic and sylvatic animals are susceptible to infection from many of the same enteric pathogens and may have more widespread carriage than humans due to less frequent disease surveillance and treatment. Keeping animals for food, pest control, and companionship are common practices in most urban and peri-urban LMICs settings and these animals are also often allowed to freely roam and forage for food in household and neighborhood areas which can spread feces with pathogens across the environment. These animals may be particularly important in sustaining endemic enteric disease burden or in disease spillover because of the higher frequency of contact with humans . Improvements in sanitation coverage does not reduce animal feces pollution in the environment so data collection on safe feces management must account for infection prevalence in animals, animal hygiene practices, and human-animal contact.\n\n\nRely upon a microbial ecology approach to detect pathogen diversity at the human-environment-animal interface to identify pathogen sources and transmission dynamics.\nStudies in urban Kenya and elsewhere have demonstrated taxonomic diversity in enteric pathogens in humans, animals, and environment in areas where open defecation, dumping of untreated sewage, and unsanitary animal management practices are common. Taxonomic diversity varies by exposure pathway, and multi-pathogen exposure risks may be elevated in infants living in underdeveloped houses with dirt floors, shared latrines, and domestic animals. Evidence on pathogen diversity in middle-class neighborhoods is unknown, although theoretically should be low if moderate to high thresholds of neighborhood infrastructure and hygiene have been met. Identifying intervention strategies that best reduce multi-pathogen transmission could improve investment in high impact developmental and public health programs.\n\n\nUse a community-based enrollment design and objective measures of pathogen presence or absence to detect transmission dynamics that are unconfounded by host type, health status, and health care utilization behaviors\nReliance upon diarrhea symptoms as an indicator of exposure can lead to biased study designs that presume health care seeking cases are exposed while asymptomatic controls are presumed unexposed. The relationships between ingestion of a pathogen, gut infection, and progression to symptomatic status are influenced by many factors, such as type of pathogen, infectious dose, host immunity, co-morbidities, and breastfeeding. Asymptomatic carriage of enteric pathogens is common in endemic areas, and these individuals can still pose a transmission risk to others, but typically go undetected due to lack of symptoms. Evidence from cities in the United States in the 1930s and 1940 suggests that city development decreased both symptomatic and asymptomatic Shigella infections. Combining community-based sampling with objective measures of pathogen presence in infants, animals, and environmental samples avoids misclassification of exposed asymptomatic subjects as unexposed.\n\n\nEnroll children between 0 to 12 months of age to improve detection of transmission dynamics\nA high pre-existing pathogen detection prevalence makes it more challenging to distinguish between persistent or pre-existing infections versus new infections and increases the chances that pathogen detection in children is confounded by pre-existing host immunity or disease conditions. Large studies of enteric pathogen detection in under- five children consistently show that detection and co-detection of enteric pathogens in endemic areas climbs rapidly within the first months of life. Recruitment of children between birth and twelve months leverages the dynamic increases in prevalence rate in this age group for identifying early causes of population disease transmission.\n\n\nUse a short-cohort, repeat measures design that matches a natural timeline of exposure and infection to improve detection of transmission dynamics\nFor most enteric pathogens, the timeline between known exposure and confirmed infection is between 1 to 5 days. The timeline between infection and recovery varies from a few days to a few weeks. Pathogen carriage and diarrhea lasting more than 14 days is considered persistent and unusual. A cohort study that spaces human health assessment by 30 days or more cannot detect exposure-outcome relationships or confirm that concurrent pathogen detections over a month or more are persistent carriage versus new exposure events. Given known temporal pathogen-host disease trends, the dynamic rate of infections in infants in Kenya, and the evidence of widespread pathogen contamination in low-income urban neighborhoods, a 14-day short cohort design with repeat diagnostic testing for enteric pathogens in infants could detect transmission events and monitor their progression. Assessing pathogen presence in infants at enrollment can improve screening for post-enrollment pathogen exposures.\n\n\nApply a Planetary Health approach to characterize household and community socio-economic and infrastructure development on enteric pathogen transmission\nNatural societal development involves improvements in many living conditions that are inherently correlated, like water and sanitation access, flooring, ability to buy safer foods and soap for handwashing, and possibly changes in zoonotic exposures. The rate with which households and neighborhood improve their circumstances can vary creating spatial variability in when and where hygiene conditions are achieved. If human and animal feces containing enteric pathogens are discarded in drains or lots in the neighborhood, it can be carried by human and animal foot traffic or flood water into the home impacting household hygiene conditions and exposure of children. Children also can be exposed to neighborhood soil, water, objects, and animal feces containing enteric pathogens during play or movement in residential environments outside the household. Understanding how changes in socio-economic and built environment conditions influence population health dynamics in the present could improve the future sustainability and health effectiveness of urban planning policies. In the context of enteric disease control, evidence is needed on how household and community development and the spatial exposures of infants influences the collapse of enteric pathogen transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\nGEOTRACKING EXERCISES"
