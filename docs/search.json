    "text": "STUDY DESIGN\nRATIONALE\n\n\n\n\nRecruit from neighborhoods representing low to moderate levels of societal development to test counterfactual hypotheses that high thresholds of basic development can reduce pathogen transmission.\nThe rapid growth in middle-class urban households in LMICs globally can be leveraged to compare enteric pathogen exposure and health patterns across a socioeconomic developmental spectrum to identify the conditions that most influence enteric disease transmission. While increases in household socioeconomic status are known to decrease the risk of pediatric diarrhea in LMICs, most studies have been based in low-income populations. Evidence from middle class neighborhoods testing are critical for identifying tipping points in transmission and accurately predicting potential program impact on health outcomes.\n\n\nApply a One Health approach that includes zoonotic and environmental health to identify all sources of pathogen transmission.\nDomestic and sylvatic animals are susceptible to infection from many of the same enteric pathogens and may have more widespread carriage than humans due to less frequent disease surveillance and treatment. Keeping animals for food, pest control, and companionship are common practices in most urban and peri-urban LMICs settings and these animals are also often allowed to freely roam and forage for food in household and neighborhood areas which can spread feces with pathogens across the environment. These animals may be particularly important in sustaining endemic enteric disease burden or in disease spillover because of the higher frequency of contact with humans . Improvements in sanitation coverage does not reduce animal feces pollution in the environment so data collection on safe feces management must account for infection prevalence in animals, animal hygiene practices, and human-animal contact.\n\n\nRely upon a microbial ecology approach to detect pathogen diversity at the human-environment-animal interface to identify pathogen sources and transmission dynamics.\nStudies in urban Kenya and elsewhere have demonstrated taxonomic diversity in enteric pathogens in humans, animals, and environment in areas where open defecation, dumping of untreated sewage, and unsanitary animal management practices are common. Taxonomic diversity varies by exposure pathway, and multi-pathogen exposure risks may be elevated in infants living in underdeveloped houses with dirt floors, shared latrines, and domestic animals. Evidence on pathogen diversity in middle-class neighborhoods is unknown, although theoretically should be low if moderate to high thresholds of neighborhood infrastructure and hygiene have been met. Identifying intervention strategies that best reduce multi-pathogen transmission could improve investment in high impact developmental and public health programs.\n\n\nUse a community-based enrollment design and objective measures of pathogen presence or absence to detect transmission dynamics that are unconfounded by host type, health status, and health care utilization behaviors\nReliance upon diarrhea symptoms as an indicator of exposure can lead to biased study designs that presume health care seeking cases are exposed while asymptomatic controls are presumed unexposed. The relationships between ingestion of a pathogen, gut infection, and progression to symptomatic status are influenced by many factors, such as type of pathogen, infectious dose, host immunity, co-morbidities, and breastfeeding. Asymptomatic carriage of enteric pathogens is common in endemic areas, and these individuals can still pose a transmission risk to others, but typically go undetected due to lack of symptoms. Evidence from cities in the United States in the 1930s and 1940 suggests that city development decreased both symptomatic and asymptomatic Shigella infections. Combining community-based sampling with objective measures of pathogen presence in infants, animals, and environmental samples avoids misclassification of exposed asymptomatic subjects as unexposed.\n\n\nEnroll children between 0 to 12 months of age to improve detection of transmission dynamics\nA high pre-existing pathogen detection prevalence makes it more challenging to distinguish between persistent or pre-existing infections versus new infections and increases the chances that pathogen detection in children is confounded by pre-existing host immunity or disease conditions. Large studies of enteric pathogen detection in under- five children consistently show that detection and co-detection of enteric pathogens in endemic areas climbs rapidly within the first months of life. Recruitment of children between birth and twelve months leverages the dynamic increases in prevalence rate in this age group for identifying early causes of population disease transmission.\n\n\nUse a short-cohort, repeat measures design that matches a natural timeline of exposure and infection to improve detection of transmission dynamics\nFor most enteric pathogens, the timeline between known exposure and confirmed infection is between 1 to 5 days. The timeline between infection and recovery varies from a few days to a few weeks. Pathogen carriage and diarrhea lasting more than 14 days is considered persistent and unusual. A cohort study that spaces human health assessment by 30 days or more cannot detect exposure-outcome relationships or confirm that concurrent pathogen detections over a month or more are persistent carriage versus new exposure events. Given known temporal pathogen-host disease trends, the dynamic rate of infections in infants in Kenya, and the evidence of widespread pathogen contamination in low-income urban neighborhoods, a 14-day short cohort design with repeat diagnostic testing for enteric pathogens in infants could detect transmission events and monitor their progression. Assessing pathogen presence in infants at enrollment can improve screening for post-enrollment pathogen exposures.\n\n\nApply a Planetary Health approach to characterize household and community socio-economic and infrastructure development on enteric pathogen transmission\nNatural societal development involves improvements in many living conditions that are inherently correlated, like water and sanitation access, flooring, ability to buy safer foods and soap for handwashing, and possibly changes in zoonotic exposures. The rate with which households and neighborhood improve their circumstances can vary creating spatial variability in when and where hygiene conditions are achieved. If human and animal feces containing enteric pathogens are discarded in drains or lots in the neighborhood, it can be carried by human and animal foot traffic or flood water into the home impacting household hygiene conditions and exposure of children. Children also can be exposed to neighborhood soil, water, objects, and animal feces containing enteric pathogens during play or movement in residential environments outside the household. Understanding how changes in socio-economic and built environment conditions influence population health dynamics in the present could improve the future sustainability and health effectiveness of urban planning policies. In the context of enteric disease control, evidence is needed on how household and community development and the spatial exposures of infants influences the collapse of enteric pathogen transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Baker. 2025. “Estimating Risk Factors for Pathogenic Dose Accrual from Longitudinal Data.” Statistics in Medicine 44 (23-24): e70291\nClick here for the paper.\nABSTRACT: Estimating risk factors for the incidence of a disease is crucial for understanding its etiology. For diseases caused by enteric pathogens, off-the-shelf statistical model-based approaches do not consider the biological mechanisms through which infection occurs and thus can only be used to make comparatively weak statements about the association between risk factors and incidence. Building off of established work in quantitative microbiological risk assessment, we propose a new approach to determining the association between risk factors and dose accrual rates. Our more mechanistic approach achieves a higher degree of biological plausibility, incorporates currently ignored sources of variability, and provides regression parameters that are easily interpretable as the dose accrual rate ratio due to changes in the risk factors under study. We also describe a method for leveraging information across multiple pathogens. The proposed methods are available as an R package at https://github.com/dksewell/dare. Our simulation study shows unacceptable coverage rates from generalized linear models, while the proposed approach empirically maintains the nominal rate even when the model is misspecified. Finally, we demonstrated our proposed approach by applying our method to infant data obtained through the PATHOME study (https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10227256), discovering the impact of various environmental factors on infant enteric infections."

Baker. 2024. “Development of a Protocol for Using Geo-Trackers to Identify Zoonotic Enteric Pathogen Transmission Pathways in a Pilot Study in Kenya.” CABI One Health.\nClick here for the paper.\nABSTRACT: Humans and animals can be exposed to fecally-transmitted pathogens in both private and public domain environments. Animals may also acquire pathogen infections from these two environments and transmit them to humans through different pathways. Evidence on how often and where interactions occur between the two environments could improve the effectiveness of public health programs for preventing zoonotic disease transmission and response to disease outbreaks. This study aimed to develop a protocol for using geo-trackers to measure the spatial-temporal movement and interaction between animals and children in households and public areas in low- and middle-income categories of urban neighbourhoods in Kenya. It also aimed to identify opportunities and challenges for the scale-up of these methods’ for surveillance of other zoonotic diseases of public health significance. One commercial geo-tracker device with the best technological performance and usability that met pre-defined criteria for the study context was identified. Community engagement meetings were then conducted to gather input on a proposed study protocol. Afterwards, infants and animals were geo-tracked in 10 households in urban informal settlements of Kibera and Jericho, Nairobi over two consecutive weeks with iterative improvements to protocols. The effectiveness of the geo-tracking exercise was evaluated through in-depth interviews with Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) and infant caregivers. Animal and infant behaviour and battery reliability of the geo-trackers were also monitored; and observed opportunities and challenges in implementing the protocol during the exercise were documented. Community members were receptive and accepted the use of geo-trackers on animals and children. In pilot testing, there was no change of behaviour from 10 infants tracked. Discomfort was observed for up to 30 min after the placement for some of the seven animals tracked, but the animals quickly adjusted. The battery for all geo-tracker devices lasted for the 24-h geo-tracking period. Some caregivers and CHVs were concerned whether the geo-trackers could record personal information. It was shown that geo-tracker devices can be successfully deployed to study animal-child interactions and movement in different categories of urban neighbourhoods. Recommendations have been made on the lessons learnt from the study to help scientists who would use geo-trackers for future community-based human and animal research."

Data on contamination levels, spatial distribution, and the diversity of enteric pathogens in the public settings of low- and middle-income neighborhoods are crucial for devising strategies that minimize the enteric infection burden. The objective of this study was to compare spatial–temporal differences in the detection rate and diversity of enteric pathogens in the public spaces of low- and middle-income neighborhoods of Nairobi, Kenya. TaqMan array card (TAC) molecular assays were employed to analyze soil samples for 19 enteropathogens, along with a selective bacterial culture for pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. An observational assessment was conducted during every site visit to document the hygienic infrastructure and sanitation conditions at the sites. We detected at least one pathogen in 79% (127/160) and ≥2 pathogens in 67.5% (108/160) of the soil samples tested. The four most frequently detected pathogens were EAEC (67.5%), ETEC (59%), EPEC (57.5%), and STEC (31%). The detection rate (91% vs. 66%) and mean number of enteric pathogens (5 vs. 4.7) were higher in low-income Kibera than in middle-income Jericho. The more extensive spatial distribution of pathogens in Kibera resulted in increases in the detection of different enteric pathogens from within-site (area &lt; 50 m2) and across-site (across-neighborhood) movements compared to Jericho. The pathogen detection rates fluctuated seasonally in Jericho but remained at sustained high levels in Kibera. While better neighborhood conditions were linked with lower pathogen detection rates, pathogenic E. coli remained prevalent in the public environment across both neighborhoods. Future studies should focus on identifying how the sources of pathogen contamination are modified by improved environmental sanitation and hygiene and the role of these contaminated public environments in enteric infections in children."

Diarrhoea remains a leading cause of morbidity and death among under-5 children in Kenya, despite multipronged policy and programme initiatives to increase access to treatment. This study interrogates the comprehensiveness and adequacy of Kenya’s policies, frameworks and action plans for diarrheal management and prevention. The study seeks to identify policy and practice gaps that need to be filled to strengthen diarrhoea treatment and prevention among under-5 children in Kenya.\nDesign. Our study is a landscape analysis, which seeks to identify the gaps in the current Kenya diarrheal policy, frameworks and action plans. The critical questions included their comprehensiveness, the availability of elaborate treatment, management and prevention solutions, together with updatedness, building on evidence from extant literature on key pathways to infection relating to man-animal environmental interaction, which are critical in enteric infection prevention initiatives.\nData sources. We conducted an internet search of databases of Government of Kenya’s Ministry of Health; relevant websites/publications of international organisations and groups (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and WHO) and published and grey literature (Google searches, Google Scholar and PubMed).\nEligibility criteria. Included are publicly available key national diarrheal policy frameworks, plans, strategies, laws, institutional frameworks and operational guidelines that inform pertinent questions on the adequacy of policy and practice and preventive policy updates and actions. Further, peer-reviewed and grey literature on diarrheal morbidity and mortality and diarrheal prevention and management are included. The analysis excluded any information that was not referenced on the internet nor obtained from the internet.\nData extraction and synthesis. The review team extracted the key provisions of the policy guidelines guided by a checklist and questions around the adequacy of existing national policies in addressing the determinants, prevention and treatment interventions of enteric infections and diarrhoea among under-5 children in the country. The checklist covered Kenyan background and diarrhoea situation analysis, policy objectives, policy strategies and policy implementation.\nResults. The analysis identified a corpus of strategies for the management of diarrhoea at multiple levels: health facilities, communities and households. The policies highlighted advocacy, health communication and social mobilisation, as well as logistics management and prevention strategies. However, the triangulation of evidence from the policy provisions and extant literature identified critical policy gaps in diarrhoea prevention and management in Kenya, particularly the lack of focus on zoonotic pathways to enteric infection, environment-pathogen linkages and operationalisation of the roles of social determinants of health and related services. The policy documents had limited focus on rapid diagnosis, vaccine development and deployment, together with weak funding commitment towards implementation and unclear pathways to funding responsibilities.\nConclusion. Policies are central to guiding programmatic actions towards effective enteric and diarrhoea prevention and management measures in Kenya. This study shows the need for policy updates to reflect pathways to enteric infections not covered in the current policy guidelines. Further, there is a need to strengthen the treatment and management of infection through rapid diagnosis, vaccine development and deployment, and strong funding commitment towards implementation together with clear funding responsibilities. Together, these will be vital in strengthening the current policy provisions and addressing other pathways to the prevention of enteric infections relating to zoonotic, environment-pathogen linkages and social determinants of health in Kenya and other low-income and middle-income countries."

Global morbidity from enteric infections and diarrhoea remains high in children in low-income and middle-income countries, despite significant investment over recent decades in health systems and water and sanitation infrastructure. Other types of societal development may be required to reduce disease burden. Ecological research on the influence of household and neighbourhood societal development on pathogen transmission dynamics between humans, animals and the environment could identify more effective strategies for preventing enteric infections.\nMethods and analysis. The ‘enteric pathome’—that is, the communities of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens transmitted from human and animal faeces through the environment is taxonomically complex in high burden settings. This integrated cohort-exposure assessment study leverages natural socioeconomic spectrums of development to study how pathome complexity is influenced by household and neighbourhood infrastructure and hygiene conditions. We are enrolling under 12-month-old children in low-income and middle-income neighbourhoods of two Kenyan cities (Nairobi and Kisumu) into a ‘short-cohort’ study involving repeat testing of child faeces for enteric pathogens. A mid-study exposure assessment documenting infrastructural, behavioural, spatial, climate, environmental and zoonotic factors characterises pathogen exposure pathways in household and neighbourhood settings. These data will be used to inform and validate statistical and agent-based models (ABM) that identify individual or combined intervention strategies for reducing multipathogen transmission between humans, animals and environment in urban Kenya.\nEthics and dissemination. The protocols for human subjects’ research were approved by Institutional Review Boards at the University of Iowa (ID-202004606) and AMREF Health Africa (ID-ESRC P887/2020), and a national permit was obtained from the Kenya National Commission for Science Technology and Innovation (ID# P/21/8441). The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05322655) and is in pre-results stage. Protocols for research on animals were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee (ID 0042302)."

The aim of this study was to test whether household environmental hygiene and behavioural conditions moderated associations between diarrhoea and enteric pathogen detection in infants 5 months of age in Kenya and pathogen sources, including latrine access, domestic animal co-habitation and public food sources.\nDesign. Cross-sectional study utilising enrolment survey data of households participating in the Safe Start cluster-randomised controlled trial .\nSetting. Kisumu, Kenya.\nParticipants. A total of 898 caregivers with 5-month (22 week ± 1 week) aged infants were enrolled in the study and completed the enrolment survey.\nPrimary and secondary outcome measures. Outcomes were (1) caregiver-reported 7-day diarrhoea prevalence and (2) count of types of enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites in infant stool. Exposures and effect modifiers included water access and treatment, cohabitation with domestic animals, sanitation access, handwashing practices, supplemental feeding, access to refrigeration and flooring.\nResults. Reported handwashing after handling animals (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.20; 95% CI=0.06 to 0.50) and before eating (aOR=0.44; 95% CI=0.26 to 0.73) were strongly associated with lower risk of caregiver-reported diarrhoea, while cohabitation with animals (aOR=1.54; 95% CI=1.01 to 2.34) living in a household with vinyl-covered dirt floors (aOR=0.60; 95% CI=0.45 to 0.87) were strongly associated with pathogen codetection in infants. Caregiver handwashing after child (p=0.02) or self-defecation (p=0.03) moderated the relationship between shared sanitation access and infant exposure to pathogens, specifically private latrine access was protective against pathogen exposure of infants in households, where caregivers washed hands after defecation. In the absence of handwashing, access to private sanitation posed no benefits over shared latrines for protecting infants from exposure.\nConclusion. Our evidence highlights eliminating animal cohabitation and improving flooring, postdefecation and food-related handwashing, and safety and use of cow milk sources as interventions to prevent enteric pathogen exposure of young infants in Kenya."

This study aimed to characterize across- and within-neighborhood diversity in enteric pathogen contamination of public domains in urban informal settlements of Kisumu, Kenya, and to assess the relationship between pathogen detection patterns and human and domestic animal sanitation conditions. Microbial contamination of soil and surface water from 166 public sites in three Kisumu neighborhoods was measured by enterococcal assays and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for 19 enteric pathogens. Regression was used to assess the association between observed sanitary indicators of contamination with enterococci and pathogen presence and concentration, and pathogen diversity. Seventeen types of pathogens were detected in Kisumu public domains. Enteric pathogens were codetected in 33% of soil and 65% of surface water samples. Greater pathogen diversity was associated with the presence of domestic animal feces but not with human open defecation, deteriorating latrines, flies, or disposal of human feces. Sanitary conditions were not associated with enterococcal bacteria, specific pathogen concentrations, or “any pathogen”. Young children played at 40% of observed sites. Managing domestic animal feces may be required to reduce enteric pathogen environmental contamination in high-burden settings."

In a subset of 212 households, we quantified the change in concentration in stored food between a morning and afternoon feeding time. In addition, household socioeconomic characteristics and hygiene practices of the caregivers were documented. The prevalence of Enterococcus in infant foods was 50% (95% confidence interval: 46.1 - 53.4), and the mean log10 colony-forming units (CFUs) was 1.1 (SD + 1.4). No risk factors were significantly associated with the prevalence and concentration of Enterococcus in infant foods. The mean log10 CFU of Enterococcus concentration was 0.47 in the morning and 0.73 in the afternoon foods with a 0.64 log10 mean increase in matched samples during storage. Although no factors were statistically associated with the prevalence and the concentration of Enterococcus in infant foods, household flooring type was significantly associated with an increase in concentration during storage, with finished floors leading to 1.5 times higher odds of concentration increase compared to unfinished floors. Our study revealed high prevalence but low concentration of Enterococcus in infant food in low-income Kisumu households, although concentrations increased during storage implying potential increases in risk of exposure to foodborne pathogens over a day. Further studies aiming at investigating contamination of infant foods with pathogenic organisms and identifying effective mitigation measures are required to ensure infant food safety."

Little is known about how contamination of milk at point of purchase and household handling of milk-based infant foods contribute to infant exposure to enteric pathogens.\nObjective: To compare the prevalence and concentrations of bacterial indicator organisms and enteric pathogens in unpackaged, fresh pasteurized, and ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated milk at purchase and assess the influence of the type of milk used to prepare infant food on contamination of this food.\nMethods: Paired samples of purchased milk and infant food prepared with this milk were obtained from 188 households in low-income neighborhoods in Kisumu, Kenya. Samples were cultured on selective media to isolate Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus spp., and Escherichia coli, with pathogens validated by PCR. Probability of detection of these bacteria was compared by milk product treatment and packaging method, and between milk at point of purchase vs. food at point of infant consumption.\nResults: Unpackaged milk was most contaminated at point of purchase, but bacterial contamination was also present in pasteurized and UHT milk at purchase. Presence of bacteria in UHT and fresh pasteurized milk at purchase predicted presence of the same bacteria type in infant food. Prevalence of bacterial contamination and concentration level for bacterial indicators generally increased between point of purchase and consumption in UHT and fresh pasteurized milk-based food but decreased in unpackaged milk-based food. Prevalence of the four fecal bacteria were similar in infant foods prepared with each type of milk.\nConclusion: Both pre-market contamination and post-purchase handling influence the likelihood of infants ingesting foods contaminated by diarrheal pathogens."

Even interventions with high fidelity and compliance saw minimal improvements in health outcomes, necessitating a need for looking beyond traditionally targeted exposure pathways. This study focuses on the pathogen exposure a young child may receive while playing in the public spaces of informal settlements, where animal feces, human feces, and garbage are frequently observed. The study utilized 79 soil samples previously collected across ten cluster sites in Corail, Haiti and processed using DelAgua cultural assays and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction methods. Molecular assays screened for Aeromonas, Vibrio cholera, and several pathogenic Escherichia coli species. Behavioral observations of young children (&lt;5 years old) were also conducted in overlapping areas with the environmental sampling to quantify frequency of risky and mitigating behaviors. Environmental and behavioral data were combined to obtain the posterior distribution of children’s pathogen exposure from playing in a public space for one hour. The model estimated that children have a likelihood of approximately 70% of being exposed to a pathogen during one hour of play and a greater than 30% chance of being exposed to multiple pathogens in the same period. While children and toddlers practice fewer risky behaviors compared to infants, they were shown to have higher likelihood of exposure and slightly higher pathogen dose per exposure. As anticipated, a high correlation between genes from the same E. coli species was observed in the model output. These findings demonstrate the need to consider public spaces as an important exposure pathway for young children for both future research and interventions."

While GI pathogen exposure in households has been rigorously examined, there is little data about young children’s exposure in public domains. Moreover, public areas in low-income settings are often used for other waste disposal practices in addition to human feces, such as trash dumping in areas near households. If young children play in public domains, they might be exposed to interrelated and highly concentrated microbial, chemical, and physical hazards. This study performed structured observations at 36 public areas in an internally displaced persons community that has transitioned into a formal settlement in Haiti. We documented how often young children played in public areas and quantified behaviors that might lead to illness and injury. Children ≤5 years played at all public sites, which included infants who played at 47% of sites. Children touched and mouthed plastic, metal and glass trash, food and other objects from the ground, ate soil (geophagia) and drank surface water. They also touched latrines, animals, animal feces and open drainage canals. Hand-to-mouth contact was one of the most common behaviors observed and the rate of contact significantly differed among developmental stages (infants: 18/h, toddlers: 11/h and young children: 9/h), providing evidence that children could ingest trace amounts of animal/human feces on hands that may contain GI pathogens. These findings demonstrate that water, sanitation and hygiene interventions could be more effective if they consider exposure risks to feces in public domains. Furthermore, this research highlights the need for waste-related interventions to address the broader set of civil conditions that create unsafe, toxic and contaminated public environments where young children play."

Little is known about which conditions pose the greatest risk for enteric pathogen exposure and infection. Young children frequently play in residential public areas around their household, including areas contaminated by human and animal feces, suggesting these exposures are particularly hazardous. The objective of this study was to examine how the dose of six types of common enteric pathogens, and the probability of exposure to one or multiple enteric pathogens for young children playing at public play areas in Kisumu, Kenya is influenced by the type and frequency of child play behaviors that result in ingestion of soil or surface water. Additionally, we examine how pathogen doses and multi-pathogen exposure are modified by spatial variability in the number of public areas children are exposed to in their neighborhood. A Bayesian framework was employed to obtain the posterior distribution of pathogen doses for a certain number of contacts. First, a multivariate mixed effects tobit model was used to obtain the posterior distribution of pathogen concentrations, and their interdependencies, in soil and surface water, based upon empirical data of enteric pathogen contamination in three neighborhoods of Kisumu. Then, exposure doses were estimated using behavioral contact parameters from previous studies and contrasted under different exposure conditions. Pathogen presence and concentration in soil varied widely across local (&lt; 25 meter radius area) and neighborhood-level scales, but pathogens were correlated among distinct surface water samples collected near to each other. Multi-pathogen exposure of children at public play areas was common. Pathogen doses and the probability of multi-pathogen ingestion increased with: higher frequency of environmental contact, especially for surface water; larger volume of soil or water ingested; and with play at multiple sites in the neighborhood versus single site play. Child contact with surface water and soil at public play areas in their neighborhood is an important cause of exposure to enteric pathogens in Kisumu, and behavioral, environmental, and spatial conditions are determinants of exposure."

    "text": "Overview\nEnteric infections remain the second leading cause of diarrheal morbidity and mortality globally in children, despite significant improvements in access to latrines and safe water sources in high disease burden countries. Our prior research has demonstrated that the “enteric pathome” - i.e. the communities of viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens transmitted by human and animal feces in the environment - ingested by children living in low-income urban neighborhoods of Kenya is taxonomically complex and varies by exposure pathway. Our preliminary data indicates that the risk of multi-pathogen infection is elevated among those 6- month old Kenyan infants fed cow’s milk and living in urban households with dirt floors, shared latrines, and cohabitating domestic animals. This suggests multiple aspects of societal development beyond latrines and water sources are required to reduce complexity in pathogen transmission in high burden countries. We hypothesize that joint modeling of enteric pathome agents across households and neighborhoods that represent contrasts in urban societal development will show that development leads to pathome evolution from complex to simple community structures, and thus lower detection frequencies for individual pathogen taxa.\nUnderstanding the evolution in pathome complexity induced by societal development and subsequently identifying effective intervention strategies is challenging since field experiments are expensive to implement, difficult to generalize to other settings, are only informed by existing, limited observational data, and sufficiently sophisticated statistical and mathematical pathome modeling tools are not currently available. The PATHOME project aims to\n\ndevelop spatiotemporal and trajectory statistical models to understand the complex exposure risks for infants from the enteric pathome,\ncollect environmental, behavioral, spatial, economic, and microbial data to characterize the enteric pathome along pathways for disease diffusion and the intersection of humans and animals with these pathways, and\ndevelop and validate agent-based models (ABMs) for predicting which social and environmental urban developmental interventions (e.g. animal penning, building latrines or drains, concrete floors) best prevent multi-pathogen transmission to infants in high disease burden countries using established Kenyan study sites as a model.\n\nOur interdisciplinary team includes a biostatistician, infectious disease epidemiologists, microbiologist, computational scientist, behavioral researcher, and urban development geographer\n\n\nFunding\nThis work is supported by the National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Center (R01TW011795).\n\n\nStudy record\nThe PATHOME project can be found on clinicaltrials.gov.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Pathogen Transmission and Health Outcome Models of Enteric Disease\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n          From Baker et al. (2023), the PATHOME team articulated the need and scientific justification for a transdisciplinary One Health study of how improvements in societal conditions influences enteric pathogen transmission between animals, humans, and the environment. The study proposed multiple new data collection methods, such as use of geotrackers for measuring human-animal-environment spatial interactions and new microbiological approaches, as well as new statistical and computational analysis methods. It also proposed a study population design that aimed to test counterfactual theories about higher levels of development reducing pathogen transmission and a novel 14-day “short cohort” enrollment timeline to detect temporal dynamics of infection and recovery for pathogens with typically short (&lt;14 day) clinical infection periods.\n    \n    \n      \n      From Busienei et al. (2024), commercially available low-cost geotrackers can be used to measure human and animal spatial movement in urban environments. Involving communities in the design of study protocols and preliminary evaluation of device technical performance and logistical plans is critical for successful and ethical data collection. \n    \n    \n      \n      From Gutema et al. (2024), soil contamination by diverse types of enteric bacterial pathogens was less common at localized and broader neighborhood spatial scales in residential areas of a middle-class neighborhood (Jericho) than in a low-income slum (Kibera) of Nairobi, with Shigella bacteria only occurring in the slums. This pathogen data addresses a critical gap in knowledge about how well improvements in water and sanitation access and housing quality influence environmental health risks in low-income countries. While pathogens were less frequent in the middle-class neighborhood, multiple types of bacteria were still detected indicating gaps in hygiene conditions for the elimination of pathogens from the environment. \n  \n    \n      \n      Building upon prior enteric pathogen co-transmission models developed by this team in the Social Microbes Study in 2018 and 2019, Houser et al. (2024) expanded this novel statistical approach to integrate quantitative behavioral observations on child contact with soil during play in residential environments with data on enteric pathogen contamination in soil from that play location in a low-income slum in Haiti to estimate children’s probability of exposure to individual and multiple enteric bacterial pathogens. Results show that infants, toddlers/early walkers, and mobile (2 to 5 years) children can ingest doses as high as 10^4 bacteria per hour for some bacteria during play in public soil in neighborhoods with poor hygiene conditions. Furthermore, they had a 32-36% chance of ingesting two or more types of bacteria during that time due to multi-pathogen contamination of that environment. \n  \n    \n      \n      From Gutema et al. (2024), Enterococcus bacteria indicators of fecal contamination were prevalent in a variety of food prepared for infants in low-income Kisumu Kenya households, albeit often at low concentrations. However, many caregivers prepare infant food in the morning and store it, typically without refrigeration, for feeding throughout the day, which lead to increases in bacteria concentration over the day. Results indicate infant exposure to foodborne pathogens occurs from many food types and are highest when food is improperly stored. \n  \n    \n      \n      Like other large enteric studies, the prevalence of enteric pathogens in feces from infants in high disease burden settings is high, but unlike other studies, we are the first to provide quantitative evidence on the incidence of new infections for several types of enteric bacteria, ranging from 16 (7.5) of 214 infants) new Campylobacter infections to 54 (25% of 214 infants) new Enteraggregative E. coli infections over a 14-day cohort period with repeat feces testing. Manuscripts reporting clinical outcomes by age group and neighborhood are forthcoming, but this preliminary data allowed Sewell et al. (preprint in review) to develop new mechanistic models that leverage information across multiple pathogens to provide dose accrual rate ratio parameters with strong biological plausibility that can be used in future models of relationships between risk factors under study and risk of infection \n  \n    \n      \n      From Mberu et al. (2024),  a policy landscape analysis of Kenyan policies for the prevention and management of diarrhea in children found interconnected policies related to health system objectives, such as providing access to Rotavirus vaccines and diarrhea and malnutrition management, as well as policies related to water, sanitation, and hand washing. However, policies did not address animal health, environmental hygiene, and the human interactions with animals and environment that contribute to zoonotic and environmentally-transmitted infections. No policies were found related to rapid, low-cost diagnostics, which remains a resource gap globally. Finally, policies were centered upon individual or household (e.g. WASH) models of health care implementation, rather than at community levels of scale. Policies addressing these gaps could improve Kenya’s success in reducing national enteric disease burden. \n  \n  \n    \n    Previous\n  \n  \n    \n    Next\n  \n\n\n\n Back to top"
