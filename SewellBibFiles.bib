The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents the usage of an artificial neural network, Kohonen's self organizing feature map, for visualisation and classification of high dimensional data. Through a learning process, this neural network creates a mapping from a N-dimensional space to a two-dimensional plane of units (neurons). This mapping is known to preserve topological relations of the N-dimensional space. A specially developed technique, called U-matrix method has been developed in order to detect nonlinearities in the resulting mapping. This method can be used to visualize structures of the N-dimensional space. Boundaries between different subsets of input data can be detectet. This allows to use this method for a clustering of the data. New data can be classified in an associative way. It has been demonstrated, that the method can be used also for knowledge acquisition and exploratory data analysis purposes.},

A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

Here we provide the first genome-scale analysis of turtle phylogeny. We sequenced 2381 ultraconserved element (UCE) loci representing a total of 1,718,154 bp of aligned sequence. Our sampling includes 32 turtle taxa representing all 14 recognized turtle families and an additional six outgroups. Maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and species tree methods produce a single resolved phylogeny. This robust phylogeny shows that proposed phylogenetic names correspond to well-supported clades, and this topology is more consistent with the temporal appearance of clades and paleobiogeography. Future studies of turtle phylogeny using fossil turtles should use this topology as a scaffold for their morphological phylogenetic analyses.},

They have been widely used in the visualization of data and information, and are especially well suited for displaying complex, multivariate data sets. The placement or layout of glyphs on a display can communicate significant information regarding the data values themselves as well as relationships between data points, and a wide assortment of placement strategies have been developed to date. Methods range from simply using data dimensions as positional attributes to basing placement on implicit or explicit structure within the data set. This paper presents an overview of multivariate glyphs, a list of issues regarding the layout of glyphs, and a comprehensive taxonomy of placement strategies to assist the visualization designer in selecting the technique most suitable to his or her data and task. Examples, strengths, weaknesses, and design considerations are given for each category of technique. We conclude with some general guidelines for selecting a placement strategy, along with a brief description of some of our future research directions.},

This fascination builds on networks' descriptive appeal, and descriptions of networks play a prominent role in recent forays into network analysis. For some time, quantitative research has included node-level measures of network characteristics in standard regression models, thereby incorporating network concepts into familiar models. This approach represents an early advance for the literature but may (a) ignore fundamental theoretical contributions that can be found in a more structurally oriented network perspective, (b) focus attention on superficial aspects of networks as they feed into empirical work, and (c) present the network perspective as a slight tweak to standard models that assume complete independence of all relevant actors. We argue that network analysis is more than a tweak to the status quo ante; rather, it offers a means of addressing one of the holy grails of the social sciences: effectively analyzing the interdependence and flows of influence among individuals, groups, and institutions.},

However, the technique is labor intensive and requires the sacrifice of animal subjects. In our work, we describe a computational method that is able to predict the presence or absence of unobserved connections, without having to probe these connections physically. The model works by learning for each of the nodes in the connectome its position in a latent space. Nodes that are connected according to the available data are placed close to one another, while disconnected nodes are positioned far apart. Unobserved connections may now be inferred by looking at the corresponding distance in the latent space. We apply the procedure to two data sets of the macaque brain and show that the latent space model is able to predict the strength of unknown connections. Furthermore, we use the model to integrate anterograde and retrograde data for the mouse connectome. Because the model is probabilistic, it allows us to quantify how certain we are about our predictions. This enables future research to determine which connections can confidently predicted, and which connections require further data acquisition.},

  abstract = {One of the central problems in cognitive science is determining the mental representations that underlie human inferences. Solutions to this problem often rely on the analysis of subjective similarity judgments, on the assumption that recognizing likenesses between people, objects, and events is crucial to everyday inference. One such solution is provided by the additive clustering model, which is widely used to infer the features of a set of stimuli from their similarities, on the assumption that similarity is a weighted linear function of common features. Existing approaches for implementing additive clustering often lack a complete framework for statistical inference, particularly with respect to choosing the number of features. To address these problems, this article develops a fully Bayesian formulation of the additive clustering model, using methods from nonparametric Bayesian statistics to allow the number of features to vary. We use this to explore several approaches to parameter estimation, showing that the nonparametric Bayesian approach provides a straightforward way to obtain estimates of both the number of features and their importance.},

Equidistant knots can be used, but their small and discrete number allows only limited control over smoothness and fit. We propose to use a relatively large number of knots and a difference penalty on coefficients of adjacent $B$-splines. We show connections to the familiar spline penalty on the integral of the squared second derivative. A short overview of $B$-splines, of their construction and of penalized likelihood is presented. We discuss properties of penalized $B$-splines and propose various criteria for the choice of an optimal penalty parameter. Nonparametric logistic regression, density estimation and scatterplot smoothing are used as examples. Some details of the computations are presented.},

A new transition kernel for a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler is developed including a general method for constructing proposals for conditionally linear parameters. A general prior for the knots is proposed which allows a varying amount of prior probability on knot vectors with nearly identical knots. A data-based prior is used for the conditionally linear coefficients which avoids the tendency to assign all posterior probability on the smallest model when the range of the coefficients is large compared to the variability in the data. Dimension changing moves include moves to increase/decrease the knot vector by an arbitrary number of knots which improves mixing; particularly, when the posterior for the number of knots is multi-modal.

  abstract  = {Ill-posed inverse problems arise in many branches of science and engineering. In the typical situation one is interested in recovering a whole function given a finite number of noisy measurements on functionals. Performance characteristics of an inversion algorithm are studied via the mean square error which is decomposed into bias and variability. Variability calculations are often straightforward, but useful bias measures are more difficult to obtain. An appropriate definition of what geophysicists call the Backus-Gilbert averaging kernel leads to a natural way of measuring bias characteristics. Moreover, the ideas give rise to some important experimental design criteria. It can be shown that the optimal inversion algorithms are methods of regularization procedures, but to completely specify these algorithms the signal to noise ratio must be supplied. Statistical approaches to the empirical determination of the signal to noise ratio are discussed; cross-validation and unbiased risk methods are reviewed; and some extensions, which seem particularly appropriate in the inverse problem context, are indicated. Linear and nonlinear examples from medicine, meteorology, and geophysics are used for illustration.},

  abstract = {The P-splines of Eilers and Marx (Stat Sci 11:89--121, 1996) combine a B-spline basis with a discrete quadratic penalty on the basis coefficients, to produce a reduced rank spline like smoother. P-splines have three properties that make them very popular as reduced rank smoothers: (i) the basis and the penalty are sparse, enabling efficient computation, especially for Bayesian stochastic simulation; (ii) it is possible to flexibly `mix-and-match' the order of B-spline basis and penalty, rather than the order of penalty controlling the order of the basis as in spline smoothing; (iii) it is very easy to set up the B-spline basis functions and penalties. The discrete penalties are somewhat less interpretable in terms of function shape than the traditional derivative based spline penalties, but tend towards penalties proportional to traditional spline penalties in the limit of large basis size. However part of the point of P-splines is not to use a large basis size. In addition the spline basis functions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving derivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may not always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the three properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease of setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based penalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather than the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off disadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based penalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity enables efficient computation with tensor product smoothers of scattered data.},

A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a high degree of separation will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than networks in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks.},

In this article, we show how counterfactual causal models may be written and tested when theories suggest spillover or other network-based interference among experimental units. We show that the "no interference" assumption need not constrain scholars who have interesting questions about interference. We offer researchers the ability to model theories about how treatment given to some units may come to influence outcomes for other units. We further show how to test hypotheses about these causal effects, and we provide tools to enable researchers to assess the operating characteristics of their tests given their own models, designs, test statistics, and data. The conceptual and methodological framework we develop here is particularly applicable to social networks, but may be usefully deployed whenever a researcher wonders about interference between units. Interference between units need not be an untestable assumption; instead, interference is an opportunity to ask meaningful questions about theoretically interesting phenomena.},

Studies in which medical treatment is randomized at the individual level potentially doubly underestimate the benefits of treatment, missing externality benefits to the comparison group from reduced disease transmission, and therefore also underestimating benefits for the treatment group. We evaluate a Kenyan project in which school-based mass treatment with deworming drugs was randomly phased into schools, rather than to individuals, allowing estimation of overall program effects. The program reduced school absenteeism in treatment schools by one-quarter, and was far cheaper than alternative ways of boosting school participation. Deworming substantially improved health and school participation among untreated children in both treatment schools and neighboring schools, and these externalities are large enough to justify fully subsidizing treatment. Yet we do not find evidence that deworming improved academic test scores.},

There has been much effort on understanding the transmission process at the hospital level; however, interhospital population-based transmission remains poorly defined. We evaluated whether the proportion of shared patients between hospitals was correlated with genetic similarity of MRSA strains from those hospitals. Using data collected from 30 of 32 hospitals in Orange County, California, multivariate linear regression showed that for each twofold increase in the proportion of patients shared between 2 hospitals, there was a 7.7\% reduction in genetic heterogeneity between the hospitals{\textquoteright} MRSA populations (permutation P value = 0.0356). Pairs of hospitals that both served adults had more similar MRSA populations than pairs including a pediatric hospital. These findings suggest that concerted efforts among hospitals that share large numbers of patients may be synergistic to prevent MRSA transmission.},

However, surveillance effort is often limited by financial and practical constraints. Although this is widely recognized, no good evidence base exists to inform the design of efficient hospital-based surveillance systems. We address the key questions of how many and which hospitals should be included in such a surveillance system. Using hospital admissions data from England and The Netherlands, we model the spread of a pathogen among the network of hospitals connected by the movement of patients between them. We show how it is possible to design hospital-based surveillance systems that deliver earlier detection times for reduced effort.Early detection of new or novel variants of nosocomial pathogens is a public health priority. We show that, for healthcare-associated infections that spread between hospitals as a result of patient movements, it is possible to design an effective surveillance system based on a relatively small number of sentinel hospitals. We apply recently developed mathematical models to patient admission data from the national healthcare systems of England and The Netherlands. Relatively short detection times are achieved once 10{\textendash}20\% hospitals are recruited as sentinels and only modest reductions are seen as more hospitals are recruited thereafter. Using a heuristic optimization approach to sentinel selection, the same expected time to detection can be achieved by recruiting approximately half as many hospitals. Our study provides a robust evidence base to underpin the design of an efficient sentinel hospital surveillance system for novel nosocomial pathogens, delivering early detection times for reduced expenditure and effort.},

  abstract  = {Infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in hospitalized patients are becoming increasingly frequent despite extensive infection-control efforts. Infections with ARB are most common in the intensive care units of tertiary-care hospitals, but the underlying cause of the increases may be a steady increase in the number of asymptomatic carriers entering hospitals. Carriers may shed ARB for years but remain undetected, transmitting ARB to others as they move among hospitals, long-term care facilities, and the community. We apply structured population models to explore the dynamics of ARB, addressing the following questions: (i) What is the relationship between the proportion of carriers admitted to a hospital, transmission, and the risk of infection with ARB? (ii) How do frequently hospitalized patients contribute to epidemics of ARB? (iii) How do transmission in the community, long-term care facilities, and hospitals interact to determine the proportion of the population that is carrying ARB? We offer an explanation for why ARB epidemics have fast and slow phases and why resistance may continue to increase despite infection-control efforts. To successfully manage ARB at tertiary-care hospitals, regional coordination of infection control may be necessary, including tracking asymptomatic carriers through health-care systems.},

  abstract  = {The increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance in hospital-acquired infections is a major public health concern that has both biological and economic causes. Here we develop conceptual mathematical models that couple the economic incentives and population biology of hospital infection control (HIC). We show that the optimal investment by a hospital for HIC changes with the proportion of patients already colonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) at the time of admission. As that proportion increases, the optimal behavior of a hospital is to increase spending to control ARB with low transmissibility and decrease spending on those with high transmissibility. In some cases, the global optimum investment in HIC can shift discontinuously from one that contains transmission to a do-nothing policy once the proportion already colonized at the time of admission becomes too great. We also show that investments in HIC are determined by a strategic game when several hospitals share patients. Hospitals acting selfishly and rationally will free-ride on the investments of other hospitals, and the level of free-riding should increase with the number of other hospitals in the area. Thus, in areas with many hospitals, the rational strategy for each hospital is to spend less than in areas with few hospitals. Thus, we predict that transmission rates and the prevalence of ARB should be higher in urban hospitals, for instance, compared with rural hospitals. We conclude that regional coordination and planning for HIC is an essential element of public health planning for hospital-acquired infections.},

  abstract  = {Author Summary The prevalence of hospital acquired infections is widely believed to reflect the quality of health care in individual hospitals, and is therefore often used as a benchmark. Intuitively, the idea is that infections spread more easily in hospitals with a poor quality of health care. This assumes that the rate at which admitted patients introduce new infections is the same for all hospitals. In this article, we show that this assumption is unlikely to be correct. Using national data on patient admissions, we are able to reconstruct the entire hospital network consisting of patients referred between hospitals. This network reveals that university hospitals admit more patients that recently stayed in other hospitals. Consequently, they are more likely to admit patients that still carry pathogens acquired during their previous hospital stay. Therefore, the prevalence of infections does not only reflect the quality of health care but also the connectedness to hospitals from which patients are referred. This phenomenon is missed at the single hospital level; our study is the first to address the connectedness between hospitals in explaining the prevalence of hospital acquired infections. Our findings imply that interventions should focus on hospitals that are central in the network of patient referrals.},

  abstract  = {Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are often seen as preventable incidents that result from unsafe practices or poor hospital hygiene. This however ignores the fact that transmissibility is not only a property of the causative organisms but also of the hosts who can translocate bacteria when moving between hospitals. In an epidemiological sense, hospitals become connected through the patients they share. We here postulate that the degree of hospital connectedness crucially influences the rates of infections caused by hospital-acquired bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we mapped the movement of patients based on the UK-NHS Hospital Episode Statistics and observed that the proportion of patients admitted to a hospital after a recent episode in another hospital correlates with the hospital-specific incidence rate of MRSA bacteraemia as recorded by mandatory reporting. We observed a positive correlation between hospital connectedness and MRSA bacteraemia incidence rate that is significant for all financial years since 2001 except for 2008–09. All years combined, this correlation is positive and significantly different from zero (partial correlation coefficient r = 0.33 (0.28 to 0.38)). When comparing the referral pattern for English hospitals with referral patterns observed in the Netherlands, we predict that English hospitals more likely see a swifter and more sustained spread of HAIs. Our results indicate that hospitals cannot be viewed as individual units but rather should be viewed as connected elements of larger modular networks. Our findings stress the importance of cooperative effects that will have a bearing on the planning of health care systems, patient management and hospital infection control.},

In a retrospective case control study, we compared risk factors for the carriage of MRSA between patients carrying spa types found among regional pigs and patients with other MRSA molecular types. Pigs carrying MRSA were identified on 70{\%} of the farms (spa types t011, t034, t108, t1451 and t2510, all associated with MLST sequence type ST398). Contact to pigs and cattle were independent risk factors for the carriage of these spa types in patients at hospital admission.

First, on a theoretical level we introduce a series-type instrumental variable (IV) estimator of the parameters of a spatial first order autoregressive model with first order autoregressive disturbances. We demonstrate that our estimator is asymptotically efficient within the class of IV estimators, and has a lower computational count than an efficient IV estimator that was introduced by Lee (2003). Second, via Monte Carlo techniques we give small sample results relating to our suggested estimator, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, and other IV estimators suggested in the literature. Among other things we find that the ML estimator, both of the asymptotically efficient IV estimators, as well as an IV estimator introduced in Kelejian and Prucha (1998), have quite similar small sample properties. Our results also suggest the use of iterated versions of the IV estimators.},

The model includes a Cliff and Ord type spatial lag of the dependent variable as well as a spatially lagged one-way error component structure, accounting for both heterogeneity and spatial correlation across units. We discuss instrumental variable estimation under both the fixed and the random effects specifications and propose a spatial Hausman test which compares these two models accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the disturbances. We derive the large sample properties of our estimation procedures and show that the test statistic is asymptotically chi-square distributed. A small Monte Carlo study demonstrates that this test works well even in small panels. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {This paper develops a unified framework for fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) estimation of higher-order spatial autoregressive panel data models with spatial autoregressive disturbances and heteroscedasticity of unknown form in the idiosyncratic error component. We derive the moment conditions and optimal weighting matrix without distributional assumptions for a generalized moments (GM) estimation procedure of the spatial autoregressive parameters of the disturbance process and define both an RE and an FE spatial generalized two-stage least squares estimator for the regression parameters of the model. We prove consistency of the proposed estimators and derive their joint asymptotic distribution, which is robust to heteroscedasticity of unknown form in the idiosyncratic error component. Finally, we derive a robust Hausman test of the spatial random against the spatial FE model. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

Our starting point is that only local information—about the neighborhood of specific vertices—is usable in practice. For this reason we consider only local vaccination strategies. The efficiency of the vaccination strategies is investigated with both static and dynamic measures. We test the strategies on real-world networks and model networks with real-world characteristics. Among other things, we find that the most efficient strategy for many real-world situations is to iteratively vaccinate the neighbor of the previous vaccinee that has the most links out of the neighborhood.},

Accordingly, two generic goals are articulated, called KPP-POS and KPP-NEG. KPP-POS is defined as the identification of key players for the purpose of optimally diffusing something through the network by using the key players as seeds. KPP-NEG is defined as the identification of key players for the purpose of disrupting or fragmenting the network by removing the key nodes. It is found that off-the-shelf centrality measures are not optimal for solving either generic problem, and therefore new measures are presented.},

The connectivity and cohesiveness metrics are assumed to be general functions of sizes of the remaining connected components and node degrees, respectively. We demonstrate that our approach encompasses, as special cases (possibly, under some mild conditions), several other models existing in the literature, including minimization of the total number of connected node pairs, minimization of the largest connected component size, and maximization of the number of connected components. We discuss computational complexity issues, derive linear mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations, and describe additional modeling enhancements aimed at improving the performance of MIP solvers. We also conduct extensive computational experiments with real-life and randomly generated network instances under various settings that reveal interesting insights and demonstrate advantages and limitations of the proposed framework.},

One such problem is to find a group of influential individuals of minimum size or the initial seed set in a social network, so that all the nodes in the network can be reached with only one hop from the seeds. This problem is equivalent to finding a minimum dominating set for the network. In this paper, we address a problem which is similar to finding minimum dominating set but differs in terms of number of hops needed to reach all the nodes. We have generalized the problem as k-hop dominating set problem, where a maximum of k hops will be allowed to spread the information among all the nodes of the graph. We show that the decision version of the k-hop dominating set problem is NP-complete. Results show that, in order to reach the same percentage of nodes in the network, if one extra hop is allowed then the cardinality of the seed set i.e. the number of influential nodes needed, is considerably reduced. Also, the experimental results show that the influential nodes can be characterized by their high betweenness values.},

In this paper, we propose a generalized KPP (GKPP) that extends existing work on KPP-Pos and KPP-Neg in such a way that it can consider network structure, node attributes, and the characteristics of edges. We also articulate a novel concept called the key player problem for exclusion (KPP-E), which selects a set of nodes to enforce the centrality of a given set of nodes of interest. To solve this problem efficiently, we propose a sequential greedy algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity. To corroborate the conceptual meaning and effectiveness of the proposed sequential greedy algorithm, we apply GKPP and KPP-E to several real and random networks.},

  abstract = {Intervention studies in school systems are sometimes aimed not at changing curriculum or classroom technique, but rather at changing the way that teachers, teaching coaches, and administrators in schools work with one another—in short, changing the professional social networks of educators. Current methods of social network analysis are ill-suited to modeling the multiple partially exchangeable networks that arise in randomized field trials and observational studies in which multiple classrooms, schools, or districts are involved, and to detecting the effect of an intervention on the social network itself. To address these needs, we introduce a new modeling framework, the Hierarchical Network Models (HNM) framework. The HNM framework can be used to extend single-network statistical network models to multiple networks, using a hierarchical modeling approach. We show how to generalize the latent space model for a single network to the HNM/multiple-network setting, and illustrate our approach with real and simulated social network data among education professionals.},

Quantifying the causal effect of peer influence presents technical challenges, however, including how to deal with social interference, complex response functions and network uncertainty. In this paper, we extend potential outcomes to allow for interference, we introduce well-defined causal estimands of peer-influence, and we develop two estimation procedures: a frequentist procedure relying on a sequential randomization design that requires knowledge of the network but operates under complicated response functions, and a Bayesian procedure which accounts for network uncertainty but relies on a linear response assumption to increase estimation precision. Our results show the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methods in a number of situations.},

  abstract = {Objective.The purpose of this study was to provide a national estimate of the number of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and deaths in United States hospitals.Methods.No single source of nationally representative data on HAIs is currently available. The authors used a multi-step approach and three data sources. The main source of data was the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system, data from 1990–2002, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (for 2002) and the American Hospital Association Survey (for 2000) were used to supplement NNIS data. The percentage of patients with an HAI whose death was determined to be caused or associated with the HAI from NNIS data was used to estimate the number of deaths.Results.In 2002, the estimated number of HAIs in U.S. hospitals, adjusted to include federal facilities, was approximately 1.7 million: 33,269 HAIs among newborns in high-risk nurseries, 19,059 among newborns in well-baby nurseries, 417,946 among adults and children in ICUs, and 1,266,851 among adults and children outside of ICUs. The estimated deaths associated with HAIs in U.S. hospitals were 98,987: of these, 35,967 were for pneumonia, 30,665 for bloodstream infections, 13,088 for urinary tract infections, 8,205 for surgical site infections, and 11,062 for infections of other sites.Conclusion.HAIs in hospitals are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The method described for estimating the number of HAIs makes the best use of existing data at the national level.},

  abstract  = {Hospital-associated infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a global health burden dominated by a small number of bacterial clones. The pandemic EMRSA-16 clone (ST36-II) has been widespread in UK hospitals for 20 y, but its evolutionary origin and the molecular basis for its hospital association are unclear. We carried out a Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction on the basis of the genome sequences of 87 S. aureus isolates including 60 EMRSA-16 and 27 additional clonal complex 30 (CC30) isolates, collected from patients in three continents over a 53-y period. The three major pandemic clones to originate from the CC30 lineage, including phage type 80/81, Southwest Pacific, and EMRSA-16, shared a most recent common ancestor that existed over 100 y ago, whereas the hospital-associated EMRSA-16 clone is estimated to have emerged about 35 y ago. Our CC30 genome-wide analysis revealed striking molecular correlates of hospital- or community-associated pandemics represented by mobile genetic elements and nonsynonymous mutations affecting antibiotic resistance and virulence. Importantly, phylogeographic analysis indicates that EMRSA-16 spread within the United Kingdom by transmission from hospitals in large population centers in London and Glasgow to regional health-care settings, implicating patient referrals as an important cause of nationwide transmission. Taken together, the high-resolution phylogenomic approach used resulted in a unique understanding of the emergence and transmission of a major MRSA clone and provided molecular correlates of its hospital adaptation. Similar approaches for hospital-associated clones of other bacterial pathogens may inform appropriate measures for controlling their intra- and interhospital spread.},

Design Systematic review of published articles. Data sources Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), and citation lists (1966-2000). Review methods Articles reporting MRSA related outcomes and describing an isolation policy were selected. No quality restrictions were imposed on studies using isolation wards or nurse cohorting. Other studies were included if they were prospective or employed planned comparisons of retrospective data. Results 46 studies were accepted; 18 used isolation wards, nine used nurse cohorting, and 19 used other isolation policies. Most were interrupted time series, with few planned formal prospective studies. All but one reported multiple interventions. Consideration of potential confounders, measures to prevent bias, and appropriate statistical analysis were mostly lacking. No conclusions could be drawn in a third of studies. Most others provided evidence consistent with a reduction of MRSA acquisition. Six long interrupted time series provided the strongest evidence. Four of these provided evidence that intensive control measures including patient isolation were effective in controlling MRSA. In two others, isolation wards failed to prevent endemic MRSA. Conclusion Major methodological weaknesses and inadequate reporting in published research mean that many plausible alternative explanations for reductions in MRSA acquisition associated with interventions cannot be excluded. No well designed studies exist that allow the role of isolation measures alone to be assessed. None the less, there is evidence that concerted efforts that include isolation can reduce MRSA even in endemic settings. Current isolation measures recommended in national guidelines should continue to be applied until further research establishes otherwise.},

We evaluated whether the proportion of shared patients between hospitals was correlated with genetic similarity of MRSA strains from those hospitals. Using data collected from 30 of 32 hospitals in Orange County, California, multivariate linear regression showed that for each twofold increase in the proportion of patients shared between 2 hospitals, there was a 7.7\% reduction in genetic heterogeneity between the hospitals{\textquoteright} MRSA populations (permutation P value = 0.0356). Pairs of hospitals that both served adults had more similar MRSA populations than pairs including a pediatric hospital.

Currently available estimators that are designed for this context depend upon the choice of a lag truncation parameter and a weighting scheme. Results in the literature provide a condition on the growth rate of the lag truncation parameter as T → ∞ that is sufficient for consistency. No results are available, however, regarding the choice of lag truncation parameter for a fixed sample size, regarding data-dependent automatic lag truncation parameters, or regarding the choice of weighting scheme. In consequence, available estimators are not entirely operational and the relative merits of the estimators are unknown. This paper addresses these problems. The asymptotic truncated mean squared errors of estimators in a given class are determined and compared. Asymptotically optimal kernel/weighting scheme and bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are obtained using an asymptotic truncated mean squared error criterion. Using these results, data-dependent automatic bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are introduced. The finite sample properties of the estimators are analyzed via Monte Carlo simulation.},

Girls, children in higher grades, and children in smaller classrooms were more accurate observers. Targets (i.e. pairs of children) were more accurately observed when they occurred in smaller classrooms of higher grades and involved same-sex, high-popularity, and similar-popularity children. Moreover, relationships between pairs of girls were more accurately observed than relationships between pairs of boys. As a set, these findings suggest the importance of both observer and target characteristics for children's accurate perceptions of classroom relationships. Moreover, the substantial variation in observer accuracy and target accuracy has methodological implications for both peer-reported assessments of classroom relationships and the use of stochastic actor-based models to understand peer selection and socialization processes.},

Complex networks are gaining more and more importance as a reference model and are a powerful interpretation tool for many different kinds of natural, biological and social networks, where directed relationships and contextual belonging of nodes to many different communities is a matter of fact. This paper starts from the definition of a modularity function, given by Newman to evaluate the goodness of network community decompositions, and extends it to the more general case of directed graphs with overlapping community structures. Interesting properties of the proposed extension are discussed, a method for finding overlapping communities is proposed and results of its application to benchmark case-studies are reported. We also propose a new data set which could be used as a reference benchmark for overlapping community structures identification.},

  abstract = {Networks (or graphs) appear as dominant structures in diverse domains, including sociology, biology, neuroscience and computer science. In most of the aforementioned cases graphs are directed — in the sense that there is directionality on the edges, making the semantics of the edges nonsymmetric as the source node transmits some property to the target one but not vice versa. An interesting feature that real networks present is the clustering or community structure property, under which the graph topology is organized into modules commonly called communities or clusters. The essence here is that nodes of the same community are highly similar while on the contrary, nodes across communities present low similarity. Revealing the underlying community structure of directed complex networks has become a crucial and interdisciplinary topic with a plethora of relevant application domains. Therefore, naturally there is a recent wealth of research production in the area of mining directed graphs — with clustering being the primary method sought and the primary tool for community detection and evaluation. The goal of this paper is to offer an in-depth comparative review of the methods presented so far for clustering directed networks along with the relevant necessary methodological background and also related applications. The survey commences by offering a concise review of the fundamental concepts and methodological base on which graph clustering algorithms capitalize on. Then we present the relevant work along two orthogonal classifications. The first one is mostly concerned with the methodological principles of the clustering algorithms, while the second one approaches the methods from the viewpoint regarding the properties of a good cluster in a directed network. Further, we present methods and metrics for evaluating graph clustering results, demonstrate interesting application domains and provide promising future research directions.},

  abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop the idea to partition the edges of a weighted graph in order to uncover overlapping communities of its nodes. Our approach is based on the construction of different types of weighted line graphs, i.e. graphs whose nodes are the links of the original graph, that encapsulate differently the relations between the edges. Weighted line graphs are argued to provide an alternative, valuable representation of the system's topology, and are shown to have important applications in community detection, as the usual node partition of a line graph naturally leads to an edge partition of the original graph. This identification allows us to use traditional partitioning methods in order to address the long-standing problem of the detection of overlapping communities. We apply it to the analysis of different social and geographical networks.},

  abstract  = {Community structure is one of the main structural features of networks, revealing both their internal organization and the similarity of their elementary units. Despite the large variety of methods proposed to detect communities in graphs, there is a big need for multi-purpose techniques, able to handle different types of datasets and the subtleties of community structure. In this paper we present OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization Method), the first method capable to detect clusters in networks accounting for edge directions, edge weights, overlapping communities, hierarchies and community dynamics. It is based on the local optimization of a fitness function expressing the statistical significance of clusters with respect to random fluctuations, which is estimated with tools of Extreme and Order Statistics. OSLOM can be used alone or as a refinement procedure of partitions/covers delivered by other techniques. We have also implemented sequential algorithms combining OSLOM with other fast techniques, so that the community structure of very large networks can be uncovered. Our method has a comparable performance as the best existing algorithms on artificial benchmark graphs. Several applications on real networks are shown as well. OSLOM is implemented in a freely available software (http://www.oslom.org), and we believe it will be a valuable tool in the analysis of networks.},

However, many real networks have more complex overlapping community structures. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to discover overlapping communities. Different from conventional algorithms based on node clustering, the proposed algorithm is based on link clustering. Since links usually represent unique relations among nodes, the link clustering will discover groups of links that have the same characteristics. Thus nodes naturally belong to multiple communities. The algorithm applies genetic operation to cluster on links. An effective encoding schema is designed and the number of communities can be automatically determined. Experiments on both artificial networks and real networks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {The Community Detection Problem (CDP) in Social Networks has been widely studied from different areas such as Data Mining, Graph Theory Physics, or Social Network Analysis, among others. This problem tries to divide a graph into different groups of nodes (communities), according to the graph topology. A partition is a division of the graph where each node belongs to only one community. However, a common feature observed in real-world networks is the existence of overlapping communities, where a given node can belong to more than one community. This paper presents a new Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA-OCD) designed to detect overlapping communities, by using measures related to the network connectivity. For this purpose, the proposed algorithm uses a phenotype-type encoding based on the edge information, and a new fitness function focused on optimizing two classical objectives in CDP: the first one is used to maximize the internal connectivity of the communities, whereas the second one is used to minimize the external connections to the rest of the graph. To select the most appropriate metrics for these objectives, a comparative assessment of several connectivity metrics has been carried out using real-world networks. Finally, the algorithm has been evaluated against other well-known algorithms from the state of the art in CDP. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improves overall the accuracy and quality of alternative methods in CDP, showing its effectiveness as a new powerful algorithm for detecting structured overlapping communities.},

Despite most researchers focus on identifying disjoint communities, communities in many real networks often overlap. In this paper, we proposed a novel MCLC algorithm to discover overlapping communities, which using random walk on the line graph and attraction intensity. Unlike traditional random walk starting from a node, our random walk starts from a link. First we transform an undirected network graph to a weighted line graph, and then random walks on this line graph can be associated with a Markov chain. By calculating the transition probability of the Markov chain, we obtain the similarity between link pairs. Next the links can be clustered into ``link communities'' by a linkage method, and these nodes between link communities can be overlapping nodes. When converting the ``link communities'' into the ``node communities'', we make a definition of attraction intensity to control the overlapping size. Finally the detected communities are permitted overlapped. Experiments on synthetic networks and some real world networks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Comparing overlapping modularity Qovwith other related algorithms, the results of this algorithm are satisfactory.},

In this paper, an improved optimization of link-based label propagation algorithm rather than node called LinkLPAm is proposed to detect overlapping community. We briefly introduce our main work. Firstly, the initialization on edge labels by rough core is presented to speed up the process of detecting overlapping community, which is a big timesaver for the link network that magnified a lot of times compared with original node network. Secondly, an optimization algorithm of label propagation on link is given to update label on edge. Thirdly, in order to restrict the number of communities and the number of nodes in the community, the metric community similarity between communities is defined and greedy mergence algorithm is taken to merge communities according to community similarity. Finally, experimental result shows that our method LinkLPAm is serviceable for find reasonable overlapping community.},

  abstract = {Introduction Many workplaces have adopted anti-smoking initiatives to reduce smoking behavior, but small workplaces are less likely to adopt these initiatives. One factor that could influence adoption is organizational culture, defined as the values and assumptions shared by members of an organization. The aim of this study was to examine the types of organizational culture associated with smoking policy strength and adoption of smoking cessation activities at small (20–99 employees) and very small (<20 employees) workplaces. Two study hypotheses were made: An increase in clan culture (characterized by participation in decision-making and human resources development) will be associated with an increase in smoking policy strength (H1) and higher odds of having cessation activities in the workplace (H2).  Methods Between June and October 2017, executives and employees coming from small and very small workplaces participated in separate surveys. Executives answered questions about their workplace’s anti-smoking initiatives, while employees completed a 12-item questionnaire about organizational culture. We aggregated employee data to perform linear and logistic regression at the organizational level.  Results Organizational culture was not significantly associated with smoking policy strength, therefore H1 was not supported. Counter to H2, an increase in clan culture was associated with lower odds of offering smoking cessation activities (OR=0.06; 95% CI: 0.01–0.58).  Conclusions We did not find support for the hypothesized relationships. External factors and additional cultural characteristics may explain study findings. Continued research on culture and ways to improve tobacco control within smaller workplaces is needed.},

Molecular tests are increasingly used to diagnose C difficile infection (CDI), but many molecular test-positive patients lack toxins that historically defined disease, making it unclear if they need treatment.To determine the natural history and need for treatment of patients who are toxin immunoassay negative and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive (Tox−/PCR+) for CDI.Prospective observational cohort study at a single academic medical center among 1416 hospitalized adults tested for C difficile toxins 72 hours or longer after admission between December 1, 2010, and October 20, 2012. The analysis was conducted in stages with revisions from April 27, 2013, to January 13, 2015.Patients undergoing C difficile testing were grouped by US Food and Drug Administration–approved toxin and PCR tests as Tox+/PCR+, Tox−/PCR+, or Tox−/PCR−. Toxin results were reported clinically. Polymerase chain reaction results were not reported. The main study outcomes were duration of diarrhea during up to 14 days of treatment, rate of CDI-related complications (ie, colectomy, megacolon, or intensive care unit care) and CDI-related death within 30 days.Twenty-one percent (293 of 1416) of hospitalized adults tested for C difficile were positive by PCR, but 44.7\\% (131 of 293) had toxins detected by the clinical toxin test. At baseline, Tox−/PCR+ patients had lower C difficile bacterial load and less antibiotic exposure, fecal inflammation, and diarrhea than Tox+/PCR+ patients (P \\&lt; .001 for all). The median duration of diarrhea was shorter in Tox−/PCR+ patients (2 days; interquartile range, 1-4 days) than in Tox+/PCR+ patients (3 days; interquartile range, 1-6 days) (P = .003) and was similar to that in Tox−/PCR− patients (2 days; interquartile range, 1-3 days), despite minimal empirical treatment of Tox−/PCR+ patients. No CDI-related complications occurred in Tox−/PCR+ patients vs 10 complications in Tox+/PCR+ patients (0\\% vs 7.6\\%, P \\&lt; .001). One Tox−/PCR+ patient had recurrent CDI as a contributing factor to death within 30 days vs 11 CDI-related deaths in Tox+/PCR+ patients (0.6\\% vs 8.4\\%, P = .001).Among hospitalized adults with suspected CDI, virtually all CDI-related complications and deaths occurred in patients with positive toxin immunoassay test results. Patients with a positive molecular test result and a negative toxin immunoassay test result had outcomes that were comparable to patients without C difficile by either method. Exclusive reliance on molecular tests for CDI diagnosis without tests for toxins or host response is likely to result in overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased health care costs.}},

  abstract = {Most community detection methods use network topology and edge density to identify optimal communities. However, in these methods, several objects that are connected by high weights may be decomposed into different communities, even when they intuitively belong to a single community. In this case, it is more effective to classify the objects into the same community because they perform important roles in controlling and understanding the network. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose a method of detecting optimal community structures in a complex network using interaction-based edge clustering. Our approach is to consider network topology as well as interaction density when identifying overlapping and hierarchical communities. Additionally, we measure the differences between the quantity and quality of intra- and inter-community interactions to evaluate the quality of the community structure. We test our method on several benchmark networks with known community structures. Additionally, after applying our method to several real-world complex networks, we evaluate our method through comparison with other methods. We find that the community quality and the overlap quality for our method surpass the results of the other methods.},

Not only do the new specifications show improvements in goodness of fit for various data sets, but they also help to avoid the problem of near-degeneracy that often afflicts the fitting of Markov random graph models in practice, particularly to network data exhibiting high levels of transitivity. The inclusion of a new higher order transitivity statistic allows estimation of parameters of exponential graph models for many (but not all) cases where it is impossible to estimate parameters of homogeneous Markov graph models. The new specifications were used to model a large number of classical small-scale network data sets and showed a dramatically better performance than Markov graph models. We also review three current programs for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and we compare these Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimates with less accurate pseudo-likelihood estimates. Finally, we discuss whether homogeneous Markov random graph models may be superseded by the new specifications, and how additional elaborations may further improve model performance.},

As a result, the reported significance levels become difficult to interpret. This article sketches an alternative interpretation of a reported significance level, valid in considerable generality. This level locates the given data set within the spectrum of other data sets derived from the given one by an appropriate class of transformations. If the null hypothesis being tested holds, the derived data sets should be equivalent to the original one. Thus, a small reported significance level indicates an unusual data set. This development parallels that of randomization tests, but there is a crucial technical difference: our approach involves permuting observed residuals; the classical randomization approach involves permuting unobservable, or perhaps nonexistent, stochastic disturbance terms.},

Such a data structure is typical in social network studies, where variables indicate some type of relation between a given set of actors. We present a new permutation method (called ``double semi-partialing'', or DSP) that complements the family of extant approaches to MRQAP tests. We assess the statistical bias (type I error rate) and statistical power of the set of five methods, including DSP, across a variety of conditions of network autocorrelation, of spuriousness (size of confounder effect), and of skewness in the data. These conditions are explored across three assumed data distributions: normal, gamma, and negative binomial. We find that the Freedman--Lane method and the DSP method are the most robust against a wide array of these conditions. We also find that all five methods perform better if the test statistic is pivotal. Finally, we find limitations of usefulness for MRQAP tests: All tests degrade under simultaneous conditions of extreme skewness and high spuriousness for gamma and negative binomial distributions.},

In this paper we compare state-of-the-art optimization techniques to solve this problem across several loss functions. Furthermore, we propose two new techniques. The first is based on a smooth (differentiable) convex approximation for the L1 regularizer that does not depend on any assumptions about the loss function used. The other technique is a new strategy that addresses the non-differentiability of the L1-regularizer by casting the problem as a constrained optimization problem that is then solved using a specialized gradient projection method. Extensive comparisons show that our newly proposed approaches consistently rank among the best in terms of convergence speed and efficiency by measuring the number of function evaluations required.},

We showed that this bias held regardless of the size of the network, the number of exogenous variables in the model, and whether the matrix W was normalized or in raw form. The networks in our simulations were random, however, which raises the question of the extent to which the negative bias holds in various structured networks. In this paper, we reproduce the simulations from our earlier paper on a series of networks drawn to represent well-known structures, including star, caveman, and small-world structures. Results from these simulations indicate that the pattern of negative bias in ρ continues to hold in all of these structures and that the negative bias continues to increase at increasing levels of density. Interestingly, the negative bias in ρ is especially pronounced at extremely low-density levels in the star network. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings.},

However, except in special cases, the computation of the standard error of Bayesian estimators requires bootstrapping, which in combination with Markov chain Monte Carlo can be highly time consuming. We discuss an alternative approach for computing frequentist standard errors of Bayesian estimators, including importance sampling. Through several numerical examples we show that our approach can be much more computationally efficient than the standard bootstrap.},

  abstract = {Summary In the absence of relevant prior experience, popular Bayesian estimation techniques usually begin with some form of ‘uninformative’ prior distribution intended to have minimal inferential influence. The Bayes rule will still produce nice looking estimates and credible intervals, but these lack the logical force that is attached to experience-based priors and require further justification. The paper concerns the frequentist assessment of Bayes estimates. A simple formula is shown to give the frequentist standard deviation of a Bayesian point estimate. The same simulations as required for the point estimate also produce the standard deviation. Exponential family models make the calculations particularly simple and bring in a connection to the parametric bootstrap.},

Our main result is that a SAR model can be written as a unique CAR model, and while a CAR model can be written as a SAR model, it is not unique. In fact, we show how any multivariate Gaussian distribution on a finite set of points with a positive-definite covariance matrix can be written as either a CAR or a SAR model. We illustrate how to obtain any number of SAR covariance matrices from a single CAR covariance matrix by using Givens rotation matrices on a simulated example. We also discuss sparseness in the original CAR construction, and for the resulting SAR weights matrix. For a real example, we use crime data in 49 neighborhoods from Columbus, Ohio, and show that a geostatistical model optimizes the likelihood much better than typical first-order CAR models. We then use the implied weights from the geostatistical model to estimate CAR model parameters that provides the best overall optimization.},

The outbreak was traced to a contaminated duodenoscope. Patient-sharing patterns can be described through social network analysis and ego networks, which could be used to identify hospitals most likely to accept patients from a hospital with an outbreak.Using Illinois’ hospital discharge data and the Illinois extensively drug-resistant organism (XDRO) registry, we constructed an ego network around hospital A. We identified which facilities NDM outbreak patients subsequently visited and whether the facilities reported NDM cases.Of the 31 outbreak cases entered into the XDRO registry who visited hospital A, 19 (61\\%) were subsequently admitted to 13 other hospitals during the following 12 months. Of the 13 hospitals, the majority (n = 9; 69\\%) were in our defined ego network, and 5 of those 9 hospitals consequently reported at least 1 additional NDM case. Ego network facilities were more likely to identify cases compared to a geographically defined group of facilities (9/22 vs 10/66; P = .01); only 1 reported case fell outside of the ego network.The outbreak hospital’s ego network accurately predicted which hospitals the outbreak patients would visit. Many of these hospitals reported additional NDM cases. Prior knowledge of this ego network could have efficiently focused public health resources on these high-risk facilities.}},

We developed a state-wide patient-sharing matrix and applied social network analyses to determine whether greater connectedness (centrality) to other healthcare facilities and greater patient sharing with long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) predicted higher facility CRE rates.Methods. We combined CRE case information from the Illinois extensively drug-resistant organism registry with measures of centrality calculated from a state-wide hospital discharge dataset to predict facility-level CRE rates, adjusting for hospital size and geographic characteristics.Results. Higher CRE rates were observed among facilities with greater patient sharing, as measured by degree centrality. Each additional hospital connection (unit of degree) conferred a 6\\% increase in CRE rate in rural facilities (relative risk [RR] = 1.056; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.030–1.082) and a 3\\% increase among Chicagoland and non-Chicago urban facilities (RR = 1.027; 95\\% CI, 1.002–1.052 and RR = 1.025; 95\\% CI, 1.002–1.048, respectively). Sharing 4 or more patients with LTACHs was associated with higher CRE rates, but this association may have been due to chance (RR = 2.08; 95\\% CI, .85–5.08; P = .11).Conclusions. Hospitals with greater connectedness to other hospitals in a statewide patient-sharing network had higher CRE burden. Centrality had a greater effect on CRE rates in rural counties, which do not have LTACHs. Social network analysis likely identifies hospitals at higher risk of CRE exposure, enabling focused clinical and public health interventions.}},

  title        = {Forecasting the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital demand and deaths for the USA and European Economic Area countries},
  journal      = {medRxiv},
  year         = {2020},
  abstract     = {Summary Background: Hospitals need to plan for the surge in demand in each state or region in the United States and the European Economic Area (EEA) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Planners need forecasts of the most likely trajectory in the coming weeks and will want to plan for the higher values in the range of those forecasts. To date, forecasts of what is most likely to occur in the weeks ahead are not available for states in the USA or for all countries in the EEA. Methods: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from local and national government websites and WHO. Data on hospital capacity and utilisation and observed COVID-19 utilisation data from select locations were obtained from publicly available sources and direct contributions of data from select local governments. We develop a mixed effects non-linear regression framework to estimate the trajectory of the cumulative and daily death rate as a function of the implementation of social distancing measures, supported by additional evidence from mobile phone data. An extended mixture model was used in data rich settings to capture asymmetric daily death patterns. Health service needs were forecast using a micro-simulation model that estimates hospital admissions, ICU admissions, length of stay, and ventilator need using available data on clinical practices in COVID-19 patients. We assume that those jurisdictions that have not implemented school closures, non-essential business closures, and stay at home orders will do so within twenty-one days. Findings: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand in the USA from COVID-19 at the estimated peak of the epidemic (the end of the second week of April) is predicted to be 9,079 (95\% UI 253-61,937) total beds and 9,356 (3,526-29,714) ICU beds. At the peak of the epidemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 16,545 (8,083-41,991). The corresponding numbers for EEA countries are 120,080 (119,183-121,107), 32,291 (32,157-32,425) and 28,973 (28,868-29,085) at a peak of April 6. The date of peak daily deaths varies from March 30 through May 12 by state in the USA and March 27 through May 4 by country in the EEA. We estimate that through the end of July, there will be 60,308 (34,063-140,381) deaths from COVID-19 in the USA and 143,088 (101,131-253,163) deaths in the EEA. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 0.3 per million between May 4 and June 29 by state in the USA and between May 4 and July 13 by country in the EEA. Timing of the peak need for hospital resource requirements varies considerably across states in the USA and across regions of Europe. Interpretation: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic will place a load on health system resources well beyond the current capacity of hospitals in the USA and EEA to manage, especially for ICU care and ventilator use. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures within three weeks in all locations that have not done so already and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasising the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding: Bill \&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the state of WashingtonAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  abstract  = {The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now become pandemic. How has it managed to spread from China to all around the world within 3 to 4 months? Li et al. used multiple sources to infer the proportion of early infections that went undetected and their contribution to virus spread. The researchers combined data from Tencent, one of the world{\textquoteright}s largest social media and technology companies, with a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference to analyze early spread within China. They estimate that \~{}86\% of cases were undocumented before travel restrictions were put in place. Before travel restriction and personal isolation were implemented, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was a little more than half that of the known cases. However, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source for \~{}80\% of the documented cases. Immediately after travel restrictions were imposed, \~{}65\% of cases were documented. These findings help to explain the lightning-fast spread of this virus around the world.Science, this issue p. 489Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome{\textendash}coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Here, we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate that 86\% of all infections were undocumented [95\% credible interval (CI): 82{\textendash}90\%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections per person was 55\% the transmission rate of documented infections (95\% CI: 46{\textendash}62\%), yet, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source of 79\% of the documented cases. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate that containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.},

  abstract     = {We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNone.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  abstract = {Summary Fine-scale predator movements may be driven by many factors including sex, habitat and distribution of resources. There may also be individual preferences for certain movement strategies within a population which can be hard to quantify. Within top predators, movements are also going to be directly related to the mode of hunting, for example sit-and-wait or actively searching for prey. Although there is mounting evidence that different hunting modes can cause opposing trophic cascades, there has been little focus on the modes used by top predators, especially those in the marine environment. Adult white sharks (Carcharhodon carcharias) are well known to forage on marine mammal prey, particularly pinnipeds. Sharks primarily ambush pinnipeds on the surface, but there has been less focus on the strategies they use to encounter prey. We applied mixed hidden Markov models to acoustic tracking data of white sharks in a coastal aggregation area in order to quantify changing movement states (area-restricted searching (ARS) vs. patrolling) and the factors that influenced them. Individuals were re-tracked over multiple days throughout a month to see whether state-switching dynamics varied or if individuals preferred certain movement strategies. Sharks were more likely to use ARS movements in the morning and during periods of chumming by ecotourism operators. Furthermore, the proportion of time individuals spent in the two different states and the state-switching frequency, differed between the sexes and between individuals. Predation attempts/success on pinnipeds were observed for sharks in both ARS and patrolling movement states and within all random effects groupings. Therefore, white sharks can use both a ‘sit-and-wait’ (ARS) and ‘active searching’ (patrolling) movements to ambush pinniped prey on the surface. White sharks demonstrate individual preferences for fine-scale movement patterns, which may be related to their use of different hunting modes. Marine top predators are generally assumed to use only one type of hunting mode, but we show that there may be a mix within populations. As such, individual variability should be considered when modelling behavioural effects of predators on prey species.},

  abstract = {Summary In the context of group testing screening, McMahan, Tebbs, and Bilder (2012, Biometrics 68, 287–296) proposed a two-stage procedure in a heterogenous population in the presence of misclassification. In earlier work published in Biometrics, Kim, Hudgens, Dreyfuss, Westreich, and Pilcher (2007, Biometrics 63, 1152–1162) also proposed group testing algorithms in a homogeneous population with misclassification. In both cases, the authors evaluated performance of the algorithms based on the expected number of tests per person, with the optimal design being defined by minimizing this quantity. The purpose of this article is to show that although the expected number of tests per person is an appropriate evaluation criteria for group testing when there is no misclassification, it may be problematic when there is misclassification. Specifically, a valid criterion needs to take into account the amount of correct classification and not just the number of tests. We propose, a more suitable objective function that accounts for not only the expected number of tests, but also the expected number of correct classifications. We then show how using this objective function that accounts for correct classification is important for design when considering group testing under misclassification. We also present novel analytical results which characterize the optimal Dorfman (1943) design under the misclassification.},

The schedules considered are constant thermodynamic speed, exponential, logarithmic, and linear cooling schedules. The constant thermodynamic speed schedule is shown to be the best. We are actually considering two different schedules with constant thermodynamic speed, the original one valid for near-equilibrium processes, and a version based on the natural timescale valid also at higher speeds. The latter one delivers better results, especially in case of fast cooling or when the system is far from equilibrium. Also with the lowest energy encountered during the entire optimization (the best-so-far-energy) as the indicator of merit, constant thermodynamic speed is superior. Finally, we have compared two different estimators of the relaxation time. One estimator is using the second largest eigenvalue of the thermalized form of the transition probability matrix and the other is using a simpler approximation for small deviations from equilibrium. These two different expressions only agree at high temperatures.},

With the development of assays that detect multiple infections, screening practices now involve testing pools of individuals for multiple infections simultaneously. Building on the research for single infection group testing procedures, we examine the performance of group testing for multiple infections. Our work is motivated by chlamydia and gonorrhea testing for the infertility prevention project (IPP), a national program in the United States. We consider a two-stage pooling algorithm currently used to perform testing for the IPP. We first derive the operating characteristics of this algorithm for classification purposes (e.g., expected number of tests, misclassification probabilities, etc.) and identify pool sizes that minimize the expected number of tests. We then develop an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate probabilities of infection using both group and individual retest responses. Our research shows that group testing can offer large cost savings when classifying individuals for multiple infections and can provide prevalence estimates that are actually more efficient than those from individual testing.},

Public health responses utilized to accomplish this goal include identification and isolation of infected individuals based on symptom presentation then monitoring of contacts for symptoms before proceeding with further isolation. In the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, this strategy was effective given onset of symptoms occurred several days prior to infectivity and as a result the epidemic was contained rather quickly [1]. A critical difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 lies in the viral transmission dynamics. SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated significant infectivity prior to symptom onset rendering the strategy of symptom onset for infection identification ineffective. A study on temporal patterns of viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 by He et al found that the highest viral load in throat swabs was at the time of symptom onset suggesting infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset [2]. The establishment that viral transmission occurs in presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and may be an important driver of the pandemic has important implications for the essential use of testing in the control of this pandemic [3]. As a result, testing to identify active infection is essential in preventing further viral transmission and therefore achieving pandemic control.}},

This review summarizes evidence that highlights transmission by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Viral load of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases is comparable. Viral shedding is highest before symptom onset, suggesting high transmissibility before symptoms. Within universally tested subgroups, high percentages of SARS-CoV-2 infected asymptomatic individuals were found. Asymptomatic transmission was reported in several clusters, including a Wuhan study showing an alarming rate of intrahospital transmission. Several countries reported higher prevalence among healthcare workers than general population raising concern that healthcare workers could act as silent vectors. Therefore, current strategies that rely solely on “symptom onset” for infection identification need urgent reassessment. Extensive universal testing irrespective of symptoms may be considered, with priority placed on groups with high frequency exposure to positive patients.}},

  abstract = {Purpose
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 92 million cases and 1.9 million deaths worldwide since its outbreak. Public health responses have focused on identifying symptomatic individuals to halt spread. However, evidence is accruing that asymptomatic individuals are infectious and contributing to this global pandemic.
Methods
Observational data of 320 index cases and their 1289 positive contacts from the National COVID-19 Database in Bahrain were used to analyze symptoms, infectivity rate and PCR Cycle threshold (Ct) values.
Results
No significant difference (p = 1.0) in proportions of symptomatic (n = 160; 50.0%) and asymptomatic index cases (n = 160; 50.0%) were seen; however, SARS-CoV-2 positive contact cases were predominantly asymptomatic (n = 1127, 87.4%). Individuals aged 0−19 years constituted a larger proportion of positive contact cases (20.8%) than index cases (4.7%; p < 0.001). A total of 22% of the positive contacts were infected by symptomatic male index cases aged between 30−39 years. The total numbers of exposed contacts (p = 0.33), infected contacts (p = 0.81) and hence infectivity rate (p = 0.72) were not different between symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases. PCR Ct values were higher in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic index cases (p < 0.001), and higher in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic positive contacts (p < 0.001). No differences between the infectivity rates of index cases with Ct values <30 and values ≥30 were observed (p = 0.13).
Conclusion
These data reveal that the high asymptomatic incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Bahrain and subsequent positive contacts from an index case were more likely to be asymptomatic, showing the high “silent” risk of transmission and need for comprehensive screening for each positive infection to help halt the ongoing pandemic.},

The resulting subspace-Stein estimator has been derived previously, in a different way, but the resulting subspace-ridge estimator is new. Unified treatments of subspace-shrinkage estimation are presented in terms of generalized ridge estimation and in terms of Bayesian estimation. The choice of shrinkage coefficient and the choice of subspace are discussed. We have considered both prior and data-adaptive selection of the subspace. Subspace-shrinkage estimation can perform substantially better than ordinary least-squares estimation if variable selection is appropriate and, moreover, does not entail as much risk of poor performance in case variable selection is not appropriate.},

  abstract  = {Given their importance in shaping social networks and determining how information or transmissible diseases propagate in a population, interactions between individuals are the subject of many data collection efforts. To this aim, different methods are commonly used, ranging from diaries and surveys to decentralised infrastructures based on wearable sensors. These methods have each advantages and limitations but are rarely compared in a given setting. Moreover, as surveys targeting friendship relations might suffer less from memory biases than contact diaries, it is interesting to explore how actual contact patterns occurring in day-to-day life compare with friendship relations and with online social links. Here we make progresses in these directions by leveraging data collected in a French high school and concerning (i) face-to-face contacts measured by two concurrent methods, namely wearable sensors and contact diaries, (ii) self-reported friendship surveys, and (iii) online social links. We compare the resulting data sets and find that most short contacts are not reported in diaries while long contacts have a large reporting probability, and that the durations of contacts tend to be overestimated in the diaries. Moreover, measured contacts corresponding to reported friendship can have durations of any length but all long contacts do correspond to a reported friendship. On the contrary, online links that are not also reported in the friendship survey correspond to short face-to-face contacts, highlighting the difference of nature between reported friendships and online links. Diaries and surveys suffer moreover from a low sampling rate, as many students did not fill them, showing that the sensor-based platform had a higher acceptability. We also show that, despite the biases of diaries and surveys, the overall structure of the contact network, as quantified by the mixing patterns between classes, is correctly captured by both networks of self-reported contacts and of friendships, and we investigate the correlations between the number of neighbors of individuals in the three networks. Overall, diaries and surveys tend to yield a correct picture of the global structural organization of the contact network, albeit with much less links, and give access to a sort of backbone of the contact network corresponding to the strongest links, i.e., the contacts of longest cumulative durations.},

In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the study design, statistical analyses, and outcomes of the many social contact surveys that have been published. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles regarding social contact surveys. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines as closely as possible. RESULTS: In total, we identified 64 social contact surveys, with more than 80% of the surveys conducted in high-income countries. Study settings included general population (58%), schools or universities (37%), and health care/conference/research institutes (5%). The largest number of studies did not focus on a specific age group (38%), whereas others focused on adults (32%) or children (19%). Retrospective (45%) and prospective (41%) designs were used most often with 6% using both for comparison purposes. The definition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g., a nonphysical contact may require conversation, close proximity, or both. We identified age, time schedule (e.g., weekday/weekend), and household size as relevant determinants of contact patterns across a large number of studies. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the overall features of the contact patterns were remarkably robust across several countries, and irrespective of the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, definition of contact), we could identify recommendations for future contact data surveys that may be used to facilitate comparison between studies.},

  abstract  = {Estimates of contact among children, used for infectious disease transmission models and understanding social patterns, historically rely on self-report logs. Recently, wireless sensor technology has enabled objective measurement of proximal contact and comparison of data from the two methods. These are mostly small-scale studies, and knowledge gaps remain in understanding contact and mixing patterns and also in the advantages and disadvantages of data collection methods. We collected contact data from a middle school, with 7th and 8th grades, for one day using self-report contact logs and wireless sensors. The data were linked for students with unique initials, gender, and grade within the school. This paper presents the results of a comparison of two approaches to characterize school contact networks, wireless proximity sensors and self-report logs. Accounting for incomplete capture and lack of participation, we estimate that “sensor-detectable”, proximal contacts longer than 20 seconds during lunch and class-time occurred at 2 fold higher frequency than “self-reportable” talk/touch contacts. Overall, 55% of estimated talk-touch contacts were also sensor-detectable whereas only 15% of estimated sensor-detectable contacts were also talk-touch. Contacts detected by sensors and also in self-report logs had longer mean duration than contacts detected only by sensors (6.3 vs 2.4 minutes). During both lunch and class-time, sensor-detectable contacts demonstrated substantially less gender and grade assortativity than talk-touch contacts. Hallway contacts, which were ascertainable only by proximity sensors, were characterized by extremely high degree and short duration. We conclude that the use of wireless sensors and self-report logs provide complementary insight on in-school mixing patterns and contact frequency.},

While testing is performed on the group, the purpose is still to understand this trait relative to each individual item. When compared to testing a large number of items separately, testing instead via groups can result in a significant reduction in the total number of tests, provided that the prevalence of a particular level of the trait (e.g., positive for a disease) is small. Furthermore, group testing can lead to more efficient estimators than individual testing if testing error is possible. The purpose of this article is to introduce how estimation can be performed with data arising through group testing. Focus is on estimating the probability an item has a particular level of the trait rather than determining the trait status of individual items.},

History of diabetes (OR = 2.60) and access to healthcare (OR = 2.38) were associated with treated hypertension, regardless of destination state. In established destinations, Latinos who graduated high school (OR = 1.19) or attended college (OR = 1.32) had higher odds of treated hypertension; whereas those who completed college were less likely to have treated hypertension (OR = 0.80). In contrast, in both new and non-destination states, the odds of treated hypertension were consistently lower across levels of educational attainment. Results highlight the need for cardiovascular-risk reduction interventions to incorporate the social and environmental context in the development process.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces shrinkage for general parametric models. We show how to shrink maximum likelihood estimators towards parameter subspaces defined by general nonlinear restrictions. We derive the asymptotic distribution and risk of our shrinkage estimator using a local asymptotic framework. We show that if the shrinkage dimension exceeds two, the asymptotic risk of the shrinkage estimator is strictly less than that of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). This reduction holds globally in the parameter space. We show that the reduction in asymptotic risk is substantial, even for moderately large values of the parameters. We also provide a new high-dimensional large sample local minimax efficiency bound. The bound is the lowest possible asymptotic risk, uniformly in a local region of the parameter space. Local minimax bounds are a stronger efficiency characterization than global minimax bounds. We show that our shrinkage estimator asymptotically achieves this local asymptotic minimax bound, while the MLE does not. Thus the shrinkage estimator, unlike the MLE, is locally minimax efficient. This theory is a combination and extension of standard asymptotic efficiency theory (Hájek, 1972) and local minimax efficiency theory for Gaussian models (Pinsker, 1980).},

After a 2-week placebo run-in period, 176 patients were randomized to seven treatment groups (placebo, quarter-dose combination, third-dose combination, half-dose combination, amlodipine 5 mg, amlodipine 10 mg, and telmisartan 80 mg) and administered the assigned study drug orally for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the mean sitting systolic blood pressure (BP) (MSSBP) at Week 8. The MSSBP and mean sitting diastolic BP in the quarter-dose and half-dose groups were significantly lower compared to the placebo and amlodipine 5 mg groups, with similar BP-lowering effects observed compared to the amlodipine 10 mg and telmisartan 80 mg groups. However, the third-dose group showed significant BP improvement only compared to the placebo group. A similar pattern was observed for the control rate of hypertension and response rates. Additional analysis was conducted after correcting for gender and age effects, and, as a result, the third-dose group showed similar results with regard to the BP-lowering effect as the quarter-dose and half-dose groups. In terms of safety, no special adverse events and clinically significant results were noted, and all dose groups of the triple combination are considered safe for use in essential hypertension patients. The current findings indicated that low-dose triple combination of amlodipine, telmisartan, and chlorthalidone over 8 weeks effectively improved the BP-lowering effect in patients with essential hypertension without any safety concerns.},

However, it is known that results from stool examinations generally underestimate the prevalence, while serology generally results in overestimation.

Problems arising with the estimation of sensitivity and specificity when two imperfect diagnostic tests are applied are widely discussed. Effects on the estimation of prevalence may be of importance as well. Different methods of dealing with two or more imperfect tests and unknown reference standard are contrasted with regard to their implications on prevalence estimation: discrepant analysis, composite reference standards, and latent class models.
Study Design and Setting
Prospective epidemiological multicenter study to determine the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus in children with lower respiratory tract infections. A subsample of 1,003 patients from a hospital population and from a practice population is considered. Virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction, and rapid antigen test had been applied.
Results
Prevalence estimates obtained under various assumptions ranged from 0.263 to 0.386 in the hospital population and from 0.214 to 0.277 in the practice population.
Conclusion
Estimation procedures involving a resolver test applied to some but not all cells are at risk of introducing a serious bias in prevalence estimation as well as in the estimation of test accuracy parameters. Estimation via latent class modeling may be more useful, but care should be taken regarding the underlying assumptions.},

Background
In epidemiologic research, incidence is often estimated from data arising from an imperfect diagnostic test performed at unequally spaced intervals over time.
Methods
We developed a likelihood-based method to estimate incidence when disease status is measured imperfectly and assays are performed at multiple unequally spaced visits. We assumed conditional independence, no remission, known constant levels of sensitivity and specificity, and constant incidence rates over time. The method performance was evaluated by examining its bias, accuracy (i.e., mean squared error (MSE)), and coverage probability in a simulation study of 4000 datasets, and then we applied the proposed method to a study of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a cohort of pregnant women in the period 1997–2006.
Results
The simulation revealed that our method has minimal bias and low MSE, as well as good coverage probability of the resulting confidence intervals. In the application to HCV study, the standard incidence rate estimate which ignores the imperfections of the diagnostic test (number of events/person-years), was 13.7 new HCV cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval 10.1, 17.4). The adjusted incidence estimates (obtained using our proposed method) ranged from 0.4 cases per 1000 person-years (when sensitivity and specificity were assumed to both be 95%) to 13.7 cases per 1000 person-years (when sensitivity and specificity were both 100%). The magnitude of difference between standard and adjusted estimates varied depending on specificity and sensitivity assumptions. Specificity had the greatest impact on the magnitude of bias.
Conclusions
Scientists should be aware of the impact of misclassification on incidence estimates. Appropriate study design, proper selection of the diagnostic test, and adjustment for misclassification probabilities in the analysis is necessary to obtain the most accurate incidence estimates.},

  abstract = {Abstract Disease progression in prospective clinical and epidemiological studies is often conceptualized in terms of transitions between disease states. Analysis of data from such studies can be complicated by a number of factors, including the presence of individuals in various prevalent disease states and with unknown prior disease history, interval censored observations of state transitions and misclassified measurements of disease states. We present an approach where the disease states are modelled as the hidden states of a continuous time hidden Markov model using the imperfect measurements of the disease state as observations. Covariate effects on transitions between disease states are incorporated using a generalized regression framework. Parameter estimation and inference are based on maximum likelihood methods and rely on an EM algorithm. In addition, techniques for model assessment are proposed. Applications to two binary disease outcomes are presented: the oral lesion hairy leukoplakia in a cohort of HIV infected men and cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in a cohort of young women. Estimated transition rates and misclassification probabilities for the hairy leukoplakia data agree well with clinical observations on the persistence and diagnosis of this lesion, lending credibility to the interpretation of hidden states as representing the actual disease states. By contrast, interpretation of the results for the HPV data are more problematic, illustrating that successful application of the hidden Markov model may be highly dependent on the degree to which the assumptions of the model are satisfied.

This is assumed to be conditionally independent given the hidden process, that is, the underlying true presence of the parasite, which evolves according to a first-order Markov chain. The model allows the transition probabilities of the hidden states as well as the detectability parameter of the test to depend on a number of covariates. Full Bayesian inference is implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The model is applied to a panel data set of malaria genotype data from a randomized controlled trial of bed nets in Tanzanian children aged 6-30 months, with the age of the host and bed net use as covariates. This analysis confirmed that the duration of infections with parasites belonging to the MSP-2 FC27 allelic family increased with age. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Summary.  Outcome mismeasurement can lead to biased estimation in several contexts. Magder and Hughes (1997, American Journal of Epidemiology146, 195–203) showed that failure to adjust for imperfect outcome measures in logistic regression analysis can conservatively bias estimation of covariate effects, even when the mismeasurement rate is the same across levels of the covariate. Other authors have addressed the need to account for mismeasurement in survival analysis in selected cases (Snapinn, 1998, Biometrics54, 209–218; Gelfand and Wang, 2000, Statistics in Medicine19, 1865–1879; Balasubramanian and Lagakos, 2001, Biometrics57, 1048–1058, 2003, Biometrika90, 171–182). We provide a general, more widely applicable, adjusted proportional hazards (APH) method for estimation of cumulative survival and hazard ratios in discrete time when the outcome is measured with error. We show that mismeasured failure status in a standard proportional hazards (PH) model can conservatively bias estimation of hazard ratios and that inference, in most practical situations, is more severely affected by poor specificity than by poor sensitivity. However, in simulations over a wide range of conditions, the APH method with correctly specified mismeasurement rates performs very well.},

Rogan and Gladen (1978) described a method to estimate the true prevalence correcting for sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic procedure, and Reiczigel et al. (2010) provided exact confidence intervals for the true prevalence assuming sensitivity and specificity were known. In this paper we propose a new method to construct approximate confidence intervals for the true prevalence when sensitivity and specificity are estimated from independent samples. To improve coverage we applied an adjustment similar to that described in Agresti and Coull (1998). According to an extensive simulation study the new confidence intervals maintain the nominal level fairly well even for sample sizes as small as 30; minimum coverage is above 88%, 93%, and 98% at nominal 90%, 95%, and 99%, respectively. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed method with real-life applications.},

However, the accuracy of the mid-point method has yet to be systematically quantified for incidence studies once participants start to miss their scheduled test dates.We used a simulation-based approach to generate an infectious disease epidemic for an incidence cohort with a high (80–100\\%), moderate (60–79.9\\%), low (40–59.9\\%) and poor (30–39.9\\%) testing rate. Next, we imputed a mid-point and random-point value between the participant’s latest-negative and earliest-positive test dates. We then compared the incidence rate derived from these imputed values with the true incidence rate generated from the simulation model.The mid-point incidence rate estimates erroneously declined towards the end of the observation period once the testing rate dropped below 80\\%. This decline was in error of approximately 9\\%, 27\\% and 41\\% for a moderate, low and poor testing rate, respectively. The random-point method did not introduce any systematic bias in the incidence rate estimate, even for testing rates as low as 30\\%.The mid-point assumption of the infection date is unjustified and should not be used to calculate the incidence rate once participants start to miss the scheduled test dates. Under these conditions, we show an artefactual decline in the incidence rate towards the end of the observation period. Alternatively, the single random-point method is straightforward to implement and produces estimates very close to the true incidence rate.}},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamic disease process is vital in early detection, diagnosis, and measuring progression. Continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) methods have been used to estimate state-change intensities but challenges arise when stages are potentially misclassified. We present an analytical likelihood approach where the hidden state is modeled as a three-state CTMC model allowing for some observed states to be possibly misclassified. Covariate effects of the hidden process and misclassification probabilities of the hidden state are estimated without information from a ‘gold standard’ as comparison. Parameter estimates are obtained using a modified expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and identifiability of CTMC estimation is addressed. Simulation studies and an application studying Alzheimer's disease caregiver stress-levels are presented. The method was highly sensitive to detecting true misclassification and did not falsely identify error in the absence of misclassification. In conclusion, we have developed a robust longitudinal method for analyzing categorical outcome data when classification of disease severity stage is uncertain and the purpose is to study the process' transition behavior without a gold standard.

Here the incidence is 795,000 new strokes, the population in the United States, and the timeframe is one year.  Alternatively, incidence can be specified as person-years. For example, there may be 324 million people in the United States for the measured year, so strokes could be specified as having an incidence of 2.5 strokes per 1,000 person-years. This means there will be on average 2.5 strokes if we watch 1,000 people in the United States for one year. To calculate the person-years incidence of strokes in the United States we perform the following: (795,000 strokes)/(324,000,000 people in the United States during the year) = 2.5 strokes / 1,000 person-years.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new horseshoe-type prior hierarchy for adaptively
shrinking spline-based functional effects towards a predefined vector space of
parametric functions. Instead of shrinking each spline coefficient towards
zero, we use an adapted horseshoe prior to control the deviation from the
predefined vector space. For this purpose, the modified horseshoe prior is set
up with one scale parameter per spline and not one per coefficient. The
presented prior allows for a large number of basis functions to capture all
kinds of functional effects while the estimated functional effect is prevented
from a highly oscillating overfit. We achieve this by integrating a smoothing
penalty similar to the random walk prior commonly applied in Bayesian P-spline
priors. In a simulation study, we demonstrate the properties of the new prior
specification and compare it to other approaches from the literature.
Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of the proposed method by estimating
the energy consumption in Germany over the course of a day. For inference, we
rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations combining Gibbs sampling for the
spline coefficients with slice sampling for all scale parameters in the model.},

We will present some basic properties of this model, including a connection between this model and a dynamical network process involving both edges and node variables, the marginal distribution of the model for edges as a random graph model, its one-edge conditional distributions, the FKG inequality, and the existence of a limiting distribution for the edges in an infinite graph.},

Inexpensive, convenient, and effective methods for predicting which patients need GSDs could help improve adoption. The purpose of this study was to determine if a Wii Balance Board (WBB) can be used to determine whether or not patients use a GSD. We prospectively recruited participants ages 70–100, some who used GSDs and some who did not. Participants first answered questions from the Modified Vulnerable Elders Survey, and then completed a grip-strength test using a handgrip dynamometer. Finally, they were asked to complete a series of four 30-second balance tests on a WBB in random order: (1) eyes open, feet apart; (2) eyes open, feet together; (3) eyes closed, feet apart; and (4) eyes closed, feet together. The four-test series was repeated a second time in the same random order. The resulting data, represented as 25 features extracted from the questionnaires and the grip test, and data from the eight balance tests, were used to predict a subject’s GSD use using generalized functional linear models based on the Bernoulli distribution. 268 participants were consented; 62 were missing data elements and were removed from analysis; 109 were not GSD users and 97 were GSD users. The use of velocity and acceleration information from the WBB improved upon predictions based solely on grip strength, demographic, and survey variables. The WBB is a convenient, inexpensive, and easy-to-use device that can be used to recommend whether or not patients should be using a GSD.},

  abstract = {Understanding multi-host pathogen maintenance and transmission dynamics is critical for disease control. However, transmission dynamics remain enigmatic largely because they are difficult to observe directly, particularly in wildlife. Here, we investigate the transmission dynamics of canine parvovirus (CPV) using state–space modelling of 20 years of CPV serology data from domestic dogs and African lions in the Serengeti ecosystem. We show that, although vaccination reduces the probability of infection in dogs, and despite indirect enhancement of population seropositivity as a result of vaccine shedding, the vaccination coverage achieved has been insufficient to prevent CPV from becoming widespread. CPV is maintained by the dog population and has become endemic with approximately 3.5-year cycles and prevalence reaching approximately 80\%. While the estimated prevalence in lions is lower, peaks of infection consistently follow those in dogs. Dogs exposed to CPV are also more likely to become infected with a second multi-host pathogen, canine distemper virus. However, vaccination can weaken this coupling, raising questions about the value of monovalent versus polyvalent vaccines against these two pathogens. Our findings highlight the need to consider both pathogen- and host-level community interactions when seeking to understand the dynamics of multi-host pathogens and their implications for conservation, disease surveillance and control programmes.},

  abstract  = {There is growing interest in understanding the nature and consequences of interactions among infectious agents. Pathogen interactions can be operational at different scales, either within a co-infected host or in host populations where they co-circulate, and can be either cooperative or competitive. The detection of interactions among pathogens has typically involved the study of synchrony in the oscillations of the protagonists, but as we show here, phase association provides an unreliable dynamical fingerprint for this task. We assess the capacity of a likelihood-based inference framework to accurately detect and quantify the presence and nature of pathogen interactions on the basis of realistic amounts and kinds of simulated data. We show that when epidemiological and demographic processes are well understood, noisy time series data can contain sufficient information to allow correct inference of interactions in multi-pathogen systems. The inference power is dependent on the strength and time-course of the underlying mechanism: stronger and longer-lasting interactions are more easily and more precisely quantified. We examine the limitations of our approach to stochastic temporal variation, under-reporting, and over-aggregation of data. We propose that likelihood shows promise as a basis for detection and quantification of the effects of pathogen interactions and the determination of their (competitive or cooperative) nature on the basis of population-level time-series data.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, epidemiological studies have focused on understanding the dynamics of a single pathogen, assuming no interactions with other pathogens. Recently, a large body of work has begun to explore the effects of immune-mediated interactions, arising from cross-immunity and antibody-dependent enhancement, between related pathogen strains. In addition, ecological processes such as a temporary period of convalescence and pathogen-induced mortality have led to the concept of ecological interference between unrelated diseases. There remains, however, the need for a systematic study of both immunological and ecological processes within a single framework. In this paper, we develop a general two-pathogen single-host model of pathogen interactions that simultaneously incorporates these mechanisms. We are then able to mechanistically explore how immunoecological processes mediate interactions between diseases for a pool of susceptible individuals. We show that the precise nature of the interaction can induce either competitive or cooperative associations between pathogens. Understanding the dynamic implications of multi-pathogen associations has potentially important public health consequences. Such a framework may be especially helpful in disentangling the effects of partially cross-immunizing infections that affect populations with a pre-disposition towards immunosuppression such as children and the elderly.},

  abstract = {Identifying the origin of fecal contamination can support more effective interventions to interrupt enteric pathogen transmission. Microbial source tracking (MST) assays may help to identify environmental routes of pathogen transmission although these assays have performed poorly in highly contaminated domestic settings, highlighting the importance of both diagnostic validation and understanding the context-specific ecological, physical, and sociodemographic factors driving the spread of fecal contamination. We assessed fecal contamination of compounds (clusters of 2–10 households that share sanitation facilities) in low-income neighborhoods of urban Maputo, Mozambique, using a set of MST assays that were validated with animal stool and latrine sludge from study compounds. We sampled five environmental compartments involved in fecal microbe transmission and exposure: compound water source, household stored water and food preparation surfaces, and soil from the entrance to the compound latrine and the entrances to each household. Each sample was analyzed by culture for the general fecal indicator Escherichia coli (cEC) and by real-time PCR for the E. coli molecular marker EC23S857, human-associated markers HF183/BacR287 and Mnif, and GFD, an avian-associated marker. We collected 366 samples from 94 households in 58 compounds. At least one microbial target (indicator organism or marker gene) was detected in 96% of samples (353/366), with both E. coli targets present in the majority of samples (78%). Human targets were frequently detected in soils (59%) and occasionally in stored water (17%) but seldom in source water or on food surfaces. The avian target GFD was rarely detected in any sample type but was most common in soils (4%). To identify risk factors of fecal contamination, we estimated associations with sociodemographic, meteorological, and physical sample characteristics for each microbial target and sample type combination using Bayesian censored regression for target concentration responses and Bayesian logistic regression for target detection status. Associations with risk factors were generally weak and often differed in direction between different targets and sample types, though relationships were somewhat more consistent for physical sample characteristics. Wet soils were associated with elevated concentrations of cEC and EC23S857 and odds of detecting HF183. Water storage container characteristics that expose the contents to potential contact with hands and other objects were weakly associated with human target detection. Our results describe a setting impacted by pervasive domestic fecal contamination, including from human sources, that was largely disconnected from the observed variation in socioeconomic and sanitary conditions. This pattern suggests that in such highly contaminated settings, transformational changes to the community environment may be required before meaningful impacts on fecal contamination can be realized.},

  abstract = {Child exposure to fecal-oral pathogens occurs through several transmission pathways. However, the relative importance of different exposure points for pathogen transmission both inside and outside households is not well understood. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the urban slum of Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, collecting 237 environmental samples from 40 households from source water, stored drinking water, caregiver hands, child hands, household surfaces, soil, standing water, open drainage ditches, and streams. We quantified the fecal indicator Escherichia coli and the enteric pathogens of adenovirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and Vibrio cholerae. At least one enteric pathogens was detected in 13% of household stored water, 47% of hand, 46% of table surface, 26% of plate surface, 75% of floor surface, 96% of soil, 56% of standing water, 77% of drainage ditch, and 100% of stream samples despite all households having access to a toilet or latrine. Our results provide evidence that children may be exposed to enteric pathogens from several exposure points, that domestic hygiene practices related to water treatment and child handwashing were associated with reduced pathogen detection in this setting, but household table and floor cleaning practices were not, that ownership or presence of chickens in the compound was associated with increased detection of C. jejuni inside households and on soil, that there were interactions among different transmission pathways for enteric pathogens, and that there were differential correlations between E. coli and enteric pathogens for different pathogens and environmental sample types. Additionally, V. cholerae was detected at several exposure points during a cholera outbreak. Overall, these results suggest that interventions that can disrupt many transmission pathways may be needed to reduce enteric pathogen exposure in this urban slum setting.},

  abstract  = {Background Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of mortality in young children. Diarrheal pathogens are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and for children the majority of this transmission is thought to occur within the home. However, very few studies have documented enteric pathogens within households of low-income countries.  Methods and Findings The presence of molecular markers for three enteric viruses (enterovirus, adenovirus, and rotavirus), seven Escherichia coli virulence genes (ECVG), and human-specific Bacteroidales was assessed in hand rinses and household stored drinking water in Bagamoyo, Tanzania. Using a matched case-control study design, we examined the relationship between contamination of hands and water with these markers and child diarrhea. We found that the presence of ECVG in household stored water was associated with a significant decrease in the odds of a child within the home having diarrhea (OR = 0.51; 95% confidence interval 0.27–0.93). We also evaluated water management and hygiene behaviors. Recent hand contact with water or food was positively associated with detection of enteric pathogen markers on hands, as was relatively lower volumes of water reportedly used for daily hand washing. Enteropathogen markers in stored drinking water were more likely found among households in which the markers were also detected on hands, as well as in households with unimproved water supply and sanitation infrastructure.  Conclusions The prevalence of enteric pathogen genes and the human-specific Bacteroidales fecal marker in stored water and on hands suggests extensive environmental contamination within homes both with and without reported child diarrhea. Better stored water quality among households with diarrhea indicates caregivers with sick children may be more likely to ensure safe drinking water in the home. Interventions to increase the quantity of water available for hand washing, and to improve food hygiene, may reduce exposure to enteric pathogens in the domestic environment.},

An additional consequence may be increased risk of malaria in early life, although the epidemiological evidence of this consequence is limited.Methods. A cohort of 527 children were observed actively every month for 30 months after delivery. Offspring of mothers with microscopically detectable placental P. falciparum infection at the time of delivery were defined as exposed. The outcome measure was malaria (parasitemia and fever). Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models and were stratified by gravidity.Results. Overall, offspring of mothers with placental P. falciparum infection had a significantly higher risk of clinical malaria during the first 30 months of life (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.1; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.2–3.7). The adjusted hazard ratio for offspring of multigravidae was 2.6 (95\\% CI, 1.3–5.3), and that for primigravidae was 1.5 (95\\% CI, 0.6–3.8). The offspring of placenta-infected primigravidae had no episodes of malaria during the first year of life.Conclusions. Our findings show that active placental P. falciparum infection detected at delivery is associated with an ∼2-fold greater risk of malaria during early life, compared with noninfection.

Latent space models provide a natural statistical framework for graph visualizing and clustering. A latent space model of particular interest is the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), which can be fit using an efficient spectral method; however, this method is based on a heuristic that can fail, even in simple cases. Here, we consider a closely related latent space model, the Logistic RDPG, which uses a logistic link function to map from latent positions to edge likelihoods. Over this model, we show that asymptotically exact maximum likelihood inference of latent position vectors can be achieved using an efficient spectral method. Our method involves computing top eigenvectors of a normalized adjacency matrix and scaling eigenvectors using a regression step. The novel regression scaling step is an essential part of the proposed method. In simulations, we show that our proposed method is more accurate and more robust than common practices. We also show the effectiveness of our approach over standard real networks of the karate club and political blogs.&lt;/p&gt;},

  abstract               = {INTRODUCTION: Global morbidity from enteric infections and diarrhoea remains high in children in low-income and middle-income countries, despite significant investment over recent decades in health systems and water and sanitation infrastructure. Other types of societal development may be required to reduce disease burden. Ecological research on the influence of household and neighbourhood societal development on pathogen transmission dynamics between humans, animals and the environment could identify more effective strategies for preventing enteric infections. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The 'enteric pathome'-that is, the communities of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens transmitted from human and animal faeces through the environment is taxonomically complex in high burden settings. This integrated cohort-exposure assessment study leverages natural socioeconomic spectrums of development to study how pathome complexity is influenced by household and neighbourhood infrastructure and hygiene conditions. We are enrolling under 12-month-old children in low-income and middle-income neighbourhoods of two Kenyan cities (Nairobi and Kisumu) into a 'short-cohort' study involving repeat testing of child faeces for enteric pathogens. A mid-study exposure assessment documenting infrastructural, behavioural, spatial, climate, environmental and zoonotic factors characterises pathogen exposure pathways in household and neighbourhood settings. These data will be used to inform and validate statistical and agent-based models (ABM) that identify individual or combined intervention strategies for reducing multipathogen transmission between humans, animals and environment in urban Kenya. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocols for human subjects' research were approved by Institutional Review Boards at the University of Iowa (ID-202004606) and AMREF Health Africa (ID-ESRC P887/2020), and a national permit was obtained from the Kenya National Commission for Science Technology and Innovation (ID# P/21/8441). The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05322655) and is in pre-results stage. Protocols for research on animals were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee (ID 0042302).},

  abstract = {Previous interpretations of infectivity-dilution curves, as obtained with plant viruses, do not account satisfactorily for some experimental observations. A new model based on theoretical considerations was derived to explain the infectivity-dilution curves obtained with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). While a single viable TMV particle may initiate infection in any epidermal cell of a leaf, each cell is assumed to have an associated probability that a given TMV particle will establish infection; it is assumed that these probabilities are not necessarily the same for all cells, but may vary from cell to cell. A mathematical expression for the infectivity-dilution curve is derived from additional assumptions about the distribution of the cell infection probabilities. An approximation, which is appropriate when a small fraction of the total number of cells develop lesions, is developed as a limiting case of the derived expression. The approximation, which is of the form y = A log (1 + BV), in which y is the expected number of lesions per half leaf, V is virus concentration, and A and B are constants, is valid under a much broader class of descriptions of the distribution of cell probabilities than that used in deriving the complete equation. In terms of the approximation, the number of lesions is proportional to the concentration at low concentrations, and is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration at high concentrations. Comparison of experimental data with the developed equations is made in a succeeding paper (Furumoto and Mickey, 1967), in which biological implications of the model are discussed.},

From establishment in early life, through to host-microbe symbiosis in adulthood, the gut microbiota plays a vital role in our development and health. The effect of the microbiota on gut development and physiology is highlighted by anatomical and functional changes in germ-free mice, affecting the gut epithelium, immune system and enteric nervous system. Microbial colonisation promotes competent innate and acquired mucosal immune systems, epithelial renewal, barrier integrity, and mucosal vascularisation and innervation. Interacting or shared signalling pathways across different physiological systems of the gut could explain how all these changes are coordinated during postnatal colonisation, or after the introduction of microbiota into germ-free models. The application of cell-based in-vitro experimental systems and mathematical modelling can shed light on the molecular and signalling pathways which regulate the development and maintenance of homeostasis in the gut and beyond.},

Poisson regression modeling offers an alternative technique which can be used for summarizing relative risk and for evaluating complex interactions with covariates. A more general application of Poisson regression is its utility in modeling disease rates according to postulated etlologic mechanisms of exposures or according to disease expression characteristics in the population. The applications of Poisson regression analysis to problems of summarizing relative risk and disease rate modeling are illustrated with examples of cancer incidence and mortality data, including an example of a nonlinear model predicted by the multistage theory of carcinogenesis.}},

As highlighted by the landmark National Academy of Medicine report “Crossing the Quality Chasm,” the U.S. healthcare delivery industry represents complex adaptive systems, and there is an urgent need to develop innovative methods to identify efficient team structures by harnessing real-world care delivery data found in the electronic health record (EHR). We offer a discussion surrounding the complexities of team communication and how solutions may be guided by theories such as the Multiteam System (MTS) framework and the Multitheoretical Multilevel Framework of Communication Networks. To advance healthcare delivery science and promote LHSs, our team has been building a new line of research using EHR data to study MTS in the complex real world of cancer care delivery. We are developing new network metrics to study MTSs and will be analyzing the impact of EHR communication network structures on patient outcomes. As this research leads to patient care delivery interventions/tools, healthcare leaders and healthcare professionals can effectively use health IT data to implement the most evidence-based collaboration approaches in order to achieve the optimal LHS and patient outcomes.},

  abstract  = {{The study of social influence has been central to social psychology since its inception. In fact, research on social influence began in the 1880s, predating the coining of the term social psychology. However, by the mid-1980s, interest in this area had waned. Now the pendulum is swinging back, as seen in growing interest in non-cognitive, motivational accounts. Our hope is that the publication of this volume will aid this movement. The chapters, written by leading scholars, cover a variety of topics in social influence, incorporating a range of levels of analysis (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and intragroup) and both source and target effects. The book also includes chapters on theories that are most relevant to social influence, as well as a set of chapters on social influence in applied settings. Finally, we include a section that considers the future of social influence in social psychology.}},

  abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether parent social influences are associated with health-risk behaviors more than peer social influences among young minority adolescents. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of seventh-grade students in a public urban magnet middle school using a survey instrument adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Youth Risk Behavior Survey. The sample consisted of all seventh-grade students in the school, and the survey was part of a needs assessment for a school-based health education program. We measured four health-risk behaviors: use of (a) tobacco, (b) alcohol, (c) onset of sexual activity, and (d) marijuana use; and five social influences: (a) parent disapproval of health-risk behaviors, (b) parent modeling of health-risk behaviors, (c) parent monitoring of health-risks, (d) peer disapproval of health risks, and (e) peer modeling of health-risk behaviors. The analyses included measures of the prevalence of health-risk behaviors, bivariate analyses to evaluate relationships between health-risk behaviors and social influences, and regressions analyses to determine the independent associations of the social influences with the four health-risk behaviors. Results: Twenty percent of respondents reported using tobacco, over 50% used alcohol in the past year, 13.3% were sexually active, and 12% reported marijuana use. Parent influences were associated with differences in alcohol use, whereas peer influences were associated with differences in all measured health-risk behaviors: tobacco and alcohol use, sexual activity, and marijuana use. Regression analyses demonstrated that peer social influences were the only measures independently associated with abstinence from tobacco (p < .05), alcohol (p < .01), sexual activity (p < .05), and marijuana use (p < .05). In all analyses, peers emerged as the most consistent social influence on health-risk behavior. Conclusion: This study suggests peers and peer group behavior may be better predictors of adolescent health-risk behaviors than parental social influences among young adolescents.},

The authors show that generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular the authors demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual’s enduring traits and his or her choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. The authors also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results.},

  title      = {Development of a protocol for using geo-trackers to identify zoonotic enteric pathogen transmission pathways in a pilot study in Kenya},
  year       = {2024},
  abstract   = {Humans and animals can be exposed to fecally-transmitted pathogens in both private and public domain environments. Animals may also acquire pathogen infections from these two environments and transmit them to humans through different pathways. Evidence on how often and where interactions occur between the two environments could improve the effectiveness of public health programs for preventing zoonotic disease transmission and response to disease outbreaks. This study aimed to develop a protocol for using geo-trackers to measure the spatial-temporal movement and interaction between animals and children in households and public areas in low- and middle-income categories of urban neighbourhoods in Kenya. It also aimed to identify opportunities and challenges for the scale-up of these methods’ for surveillance of other zoonotic diseases of public health significance. One commercial geo-tracker device with the best technological performance and usability that met pre-defined criteria for the study context was identified. Community engagement meetings were then conducted to gather input on a proposed study protocol. Afterwards, infants and animals were geo-tracked in 10 households in urban informal settlements of Kibera and Jericho, Nairobi over two consecutive weeks with iterative improvements to protocols. The effectiveness of the geo-tracking exercise was evaluated through in-depth interviews with Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) and infant caregivers. Animal and infant behaviour and battery reliability of the geo-trackers were also monitored; and observed opportunities and challenges in implementing the protocol during the exercise were documented. Community members were receptive and accepted the use of geo-trackers on animals and children. In pilot testing, there was no change of behaviour from 10 infants tracked. Discomfort was observed for up to 30 min after the placement for some of the seven animals tracked, but the animals quickly adjusted. The battery for all geo-tracker devices lasted for the 24-h geo-tracking period. Some caregivers and CHVs were concerned whether the geo-trackers could record personal information. It was shown that geo-tracker devices can be successfully deployed to study animal-child interactions and movement in different categories of urban neighbourhoods. Recommendations have been made on the lessons learnt from the study to help scientists who would use geo-trackers for future community-based human and animal research.  One Health impact statement Assessing human and animal risks of acquiring enteric infections from environmental contamination, or contributing to pathogen contamination of the environment requires understanding spatial-temporal patterns of human and animal movement between private households and the community. Movement of domestic animals is relevant for understanding household-community spatial patterns of pathogen transmission because animal ownership and contact with humans is common, and free-roaming animals carrying enteric pathogens can spread diverse faecal pathogens between environments. The community-based participatory research approach of this study evaluated implementation feasibility from the lens of technical usability and reliability of geo-tracking devices, as well as social acceptability and ethics related to using such devices for the community-based study of human and animal subjects in urban settings. Evidence and recommendations from this study will be useful to anyone interested in understanding human-animal-environment interactions and their contributions to infectious disease transmission.},

In 18\% of samples, E. coli O157 could only be isolated using immunomagnetic separation after an enrichment period, suggesting concentrations \&lt;250 CFU g−1. The highest concentrations recorded were 6·7 × 105 and 1·6 × 106 CFU g−1 for studies 1 and 2 respectively.Conclusions:  Persistent, high shedders (shedding \&gt;103 CFU g−1) were evident in both studies but, in the majority of calves, the pathogen was isolated intermittently.Significance and Impact of the Study:  The variable patterns of shedding have important implications for the design of appropriate sampling protocols and for gaining meaningful estimates of parameters used in mathematical models of transmission.}},

Sequential stool samples (n = 345) from 10 children with rotavirus associated diarrhea and from five children (n = 161) with asymptomatic rotavirus infection were collected over a period of 2 months. A RT-qPCR assay on the samples using a rotavirus VP6 plasmid standard demonstrated high reproducibility, with an inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) of 1.40–2.97\% and an intra-assay CV of 0.03–3.03\%. The median duration of shedding was longer in children with diarrhea compared to asymptomatic children (24 days vs. 18 days; P = 0.066). The median quantitation cycle (Cq) at presentation in symptomatic children was 17.21 compared to 30.98 in asymptomatic children (P = 0.086). The temporal pattern in symptomatic children consisted of a high initial viral shedding coinciding with the duration of diarrhea, followed by a rapid fall, and then a small increase in secondary shedding 21 days later. Compared to children with rotavirus diarrhea, those with asymptomatic infection shed lower quantities of virus throughout the observation period. No difference was noted between the G and P genotypes of samples collected at onset of infection and during the shedding period. Shedding was intermittent in a subset of children in both groups. RT-qPCR is a useful method to characterize shedding patterns. J. Med. Virol. 85:1661–1668, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {{Noroviruses (NoV) are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis world-wide. NoV infections are often asymptomatic, although individuals still shed large amounts of NoV in their stool. Understanding the differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals would help in elucidating mechanisms of NoV pathogenesis. Our goal was to compare the serum cytokine responses and faecal viral RNA titres of asymptomatic and symptomatic NoV-infected individuals. We tested serum samples from infected subjects (n = 26; 19 symptomatic, seven asymptomatic) from two human challenge studies of GI.1 NoV for 16 cytokines. Samples from prechallenge and days 1-4 post-challenge were tested for these cytokines. Cytokine levels were compared to stool NoV RNA titres quantified previously by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR). While both symptomatic and asymptomatic groups had similar patterns of cytokine responses, the symptomatic group generally exhibited a greater elevation of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines and IL-8 post-challenge compared to the asymptomatic group (all P \&lt; 0·01). Daily viral RNA titre was associated positively with daily IL-6 concentration and negatively with daily IL-12p40 concentration (all P \&lt; 0·05). Symptoms were not associated significantly with daily viral RNA titre, duration of viral shedding or cumulative shedding. Symptomatic individuals, compared to asymptomatic, have greater immune system activation, as measured by serum cytokines, but they do not have greater viral burden, as measured by titre and shedding, suggesting that symptoms may be immune-mediated in NoV infection.}},

The median duration of postdiarrheal carriage varied widely by pathogen, from about 1 week for rotavirus (median, 8.1 days [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 6.2–9.6]) to \&gt;1 month for Cryptosporidium (39.5 days [95\% CI, 30.6–49.0]).

  abstract  = {Introduction We describe a method for analyzing the within-household network dynamics of a disease transmission. We apply it to analyze the occurrences of endemic diarrheal disease in Cameroon, Central Africa based on observational, cross-sectional data available from household health surveys.   Methods To analyze the data, we apply formalism of the dynamic SID (susceptible-infected-diseased) process that describes the disease steady-state while adjusting for the household age-structure and environment contamination, such as water contamination. The SID transmission rates are estimated via MCMC method with the help of the so-called synthetic likelihood approach.   Results The SID model is fitted to a dataset on diarrhea occurrence from 63 households in Cameroon. We show that the model allows for quantification of the effects of drinking water contamination on both transmission and recovery rates for household diarrheal disease occurrence as well as for estimation of the rate of silent (unobserved) infections.   Conclusions The new estimation method appears capable of genuinely capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission across various human, animal and environmental compartments at the household level. Our approach is quite general and can be used in other epidemiological settings where it is desirable to fit transmission rates using cross-sectional data.

  abstract  = {The annual number of deaths from diarrheal diseases among the 0–4 year age group in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has dropped by 89 percent, from 4.6 million in 1980 to 526,000 in 2015 (Liu, Hill and others 2016). This striking improvement occurred without vaccines against the major pathogens, except for rotavirus, which is now being scaled-up in LMICs. The incidence of diarrhea has not significantly diminished, especially in young infants (Fischer Walker and others 2012). Therefore, success in reducing mortality appears to be driven largely by improved management rather than prevention (box 9.1). Each day, 4.7 million episodes of diarrheal disease occur, including 100,000 cases of severe diarrhea, along with nearly 1,600 deaths, approximately 9 percent of the mortality in children under age five years (chapter 4 in this volume, Liu, Oza, and others 2016). Increasing awareness of the adverse effects of nonfatal episodes of diarrhea on infant and childhood growth and development, particularly the role of repeated illness and the potential impact of frequent subclinical infections with the same pathogens, presents a new challenge. Interventions will depend on enhanced understanding of causal pathways, pathogenesis, and sequelae of these infections, with or without symptomatic diarrhea. Diarrheal diseases are good indicators of the stage of development of communities in LMICs because of the impact of proximal and distal determinants of diarrheal morbidity and mortality, including the availability of safe drinking water; sanitation; level of education, particularly of mothers; income; food security; nutrition; and access to health care, both preventive and therapeutic. Continued progress depends on recognition that intersectoral interventions are integral to required measures to reduce or eliminate diarrheal diseases as a public health concern. This chapter explores the still-limited evidence on subclinical infections due to known microbial causes of diarrhea, and impacts on intestinal physiology, nutrient absorption, and nutritional status as plausible mechanisms underlying growth stunting and developmental delays. The potential interventions for clinical and sub-clinical intestinal infections are not necessarily identical, although they undoubtedly overlap. Accordingly, we consider epidemiology, transmission, and mechanisms of disease, as well as social and cultural factors instrumental in determining outcomes. Nutritional needs of infants and young children, breastfeeding practices, use of complementary foods, and management of nutritional rehabilitation of acute malnutrition are covered in greater depth in Das and others (2016, chapter 12 of this volume).},

Research has shown that the positive effect of nutritional supplementation on child growth in malnourished populations is small relative to the large negative effect of diarrheal disease. To test the hypothesis that the effects of supplementation and diarrhea are synergistic in that supplementation modifies the negative effect of diarrhea on linear growth, length and diarrheal morbidity were compared at 36 mo of age for two cohorts of Colombian children: supplemented from birth and unsupplemented. Among unsupplemented children diarrhea was negatively associated with length. Among supplemented children diarrhea had no effect on length and differed from that of unsupplemented children. Thus, supplementation completely offset the negative effect of diarrheal disease on length. Targeting supplementation programs to the critical period of high diarrheal prevalence among infants and young children should increase the effectiveness of such programs in preventing growth retardation associated with diarrhea.},

  abstract  = {Every year{,} more than half a million children die due to diarrheal diseases. Recent studies have identified the most important etiologies of diarrheal disease are enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic E. coli{,} Shigella spp.{,} rotavirus{,} norovirus and Cryptosporidium spp. These etiologies are unsurprisingly characterized by a combination of high shedding{,} high infectivity{,} and transmissibility through multiple environmental reservoirs. The relative importance of the transmission routes is likely site-specific. So the impact of interventions{,} which typically target only one or two environmental reservoirs{,} is likely also site-specific. The factors influencing the transmission routes most important for diarrheal disease are complex{,} including – at a minimum – etiology of endemic disease; and water{,} sanitation{,} and hygiene infrastructure and practices. The site-specific nature – and complexity of transmission – helps explain the observed variation in impacts of water{,} sanitation{,} and hygiene interventions. It may also render efforts to estimate or quantify global means for interventions{'} impacts irrelevant. The theme of this Perspective is that greater reductions in diarrheal disease transmission in LMICs can be achieved by designing interventions to interrupt the most important environmental transmission pathways. Intervention choice should be informed by site-specific conditions{,} most notably: diarrheal etiology and existing water{,} sanitation{,} and hygiene infrastructure and practices. The theme is discussed through the lens of the characteristics of the most important diarrheal diseases (shedding{,} infectivity{,} growth{,} and persistence) and the general characteristics of environmental reservoirs (exposure pathways and fecal contamination). The discussion highlights when interventions – and combinations of interventions – will be most effective at reducing diarrheal disease burden.},

Whether family members are more likely to experience a CDI following CDI in another separate family member remains to be studied.To determine the incidence of potential family transmission of CDI.In this case-control study comparing the incidence of CDI among individuals with prior exposure to a family member with CDI to those without prior family exposure, individuals were binned into monthly enrollment strata based on exposure status (eg, family exposure) and confounding factors (eg, age, prior antibiotic use). Data were derived from population-based, longitudinal commercial insurance claims from the Truven Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental databases from 2001 to 2017. Households with at least 2 family members continuously enrolled for at least 1 month were eligible. CDI incidence was computed within each stratum. A regression model was used to compare incidence of CDI while controlling for possible confounding characteristics.Index CDI cases were identified using inpatient and outpatient diagnosis codes. Exposure risks 60 days prior to infection included CDI diagnosed in another family member, prior hospitalization, and antibiotic use.The primary outcome was the incidence of CDI in a given monthly enrollment stratum. Separate analyses were considered for CDI diagnosed in outpatient or hospital settings.A total of 224 818 cases of CDI, representing 194 424 enrollees (55.9\% female; mean [SD] age, 52.8 [22.2] years) occurred in families with at least 2 enrollees. Of these, 1074 CDI events (4.8\%) occurred following CDI diagnosis in a separate family member. Prior family exposure was significantly associated with increased incidence of CDI, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 12.47 (95\% CI, 8.86-16.97); this prior family exposure represented the factor with the second highest IRR behind hospital exposure (IRR, 16.18 [95\% CI, 15.31-17.10]). For community-onset CDI cases without prior hospitalization, the IRR for family exposure was 21.74 (95\% CI, 15.12-30.01). Age (IRR, 9.90 [95\% CI, 8.92-10.98] for ages ≥65 years compared with ages 0-17 years), antibiotic use (IRR, 3.73 [95\% CI, 3.41-4.08] for low-risk and 14.26 [95\% CI, 13.27-15.31] for high-risk antibiotics compared with no antibiotics), and female sex (IRR, 1.44 [95\% CI, 1.36-1.53]) were also positively associated with incidence.This study found that individuals with family exposure may be at significantly greater risk for acquiring CDI, which highlights the importance of the shared environment in the transmission and acquisition of C difficile.}},

Exposures and effect modifiers included water access and treatment, cohabitation with domestic animals, sanitation access, handwashing practices, supplemental feeding, access to refrigeration and flooring.Results Reported handwashing after handling animals (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.20; 95\% CI=0.06 to 0.50) and before eating (aOR=0.44; 95\% CI=0.26 to 0.73) were strongly associated with lower risk of caregiver-reported diarrhoea, while cohabitation with animals (aOR=1.54; 95\% CI=1.01 to 2.34) living in a household with vinyl-covered dirt floors (aOR=0.60; 95\% CI=0.45 to 0.87) were strongly associated with pathogen codetection in infants. Caregiver handwashing after child (p=0.02) or self-defecation (p=0.03) moderated the relationship between shared sanitation access and infant exposure to pathogens, specifically private latrine access was protective against pathogen exposure of infants in households, where caregivers washed hands after defecation. In the absence of handwashing, access to private sanitation posed no benefits over shared latrines for protecting infants from exposure.Conclusion Our evidence highlights eliminating animal cohabitation and improving flooring, postdefecation and food-related handwashing, and safety and use of cow milk sources as interventions to prevent enteric pathogen exposure of young infants in Kenya.Trial registration number NCT03468114Data are available upon reasonable request.

A systematic review of literature was carried out that aimed to identify and analyse the impact of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions (WASH) in schools in low-income countries. Published peer reviewed literature was systematically screened during March to June 2018 using the databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. There were no publication date restrictions. Thirty-eight peer reviewed papers were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The papers were analysed in groups, based on four categories of reported outcomes: (i) reduction of diarrhoeal disease and other hygiene-related diseases in school students; (ii) improved WASH knowledge, attitudes and hygiene behaviours among students; (iii) reduced disease burden and improved hygiene behaviours in students’ households and communities; (iv) improved student enrolment and attendance. The typically unmeasured and unreported ‘output’ and/or ‘exposure’ of program fidelity and adherence was also examined. Several studies provide evidence of positive disease-related outcomes among students, yet other assessments did not find statistically significant differences in health or indicated that outcomes are dependent on the nature and context of interventions. Thirteen studies provide evidence of changes in WASH knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, such as hand-washing with soap. Further research is required to understand whether and how school-based WASH interventions might improve hygiene habits and health among wider family and community members. Evidence of the impact of school-based WASH programs in reducing student absence from school was mixed. Ensuring access to safe and sufficient water and sanitation and hygiene promotion in schools has great potential to improve health and education and to contribute to inclusion and equity, yet delivering school-based WASH intervention does not guarantee good outcomes. While further rigorous research will be of value, political will and effective interventions with high program fidelity are also key.},

Currently, we know little about the health effectiveness of behaviour-based water and hygiene interventions after the conclusion of intervention activities.Methods We present an extension of previously published design (propensity score matching) and analysis (targeted maximum likelihood estimation) methods to evaluate the behavioural and health impacts of a pre-existing but non-randomized intervention (a 3-year, combined household water treatment and handwashing campaign in rural Guatemala). Six months after the intervention, we conducted a cross-sectional cohort study in 30 villages (15 intervention and 15 control) that included 600 households, and 929 children \&lt;5 years of age.Results The study design created a sample of intervention and control villages that were comparable across more than 30 potentially confounding characteristics. The intervention led to modest gains in confirmed water treatment behaviour [risk difference = 0.05, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.02–0.09]. We found, however, no difference between the intervention and control villages in self-reported handwashing behaviour, spot-check hygiene conditions, or the prevalence of child diarrhoea, clinical acute lower respiratory infections or child growth.Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first post-intervention follow-up study of a combined household water treatment and handwashing behaviour change intervention, and the first post-intervention follow-up of either intervention type to include child health measurement. The lack of child health impacts is consistent with unsustained behaviour adoption. Our findings highlight the difficulty of implementing behaviour-based household water treatment and handwashing outside of intensive efficacy trials.}},

  abstract               = {Public spaces in countries with limited societal development can be contaminated with feces containing pathogenic microbes from animals and people. Data on contamination levels, spatial distribution, and the diversity of enteric pathogens in the public settings of low- and middle-income neighborhoods are crucial for devising strategies that minimize the enteric infection burden. The objective of this study was to compare spatial-temporal differences in the detection rate and diversity of enteric pathogens in the public spaces of low- and middle-income neighborhoods of Nairobi, Kenya. TaqMan array card (TAC) molecular assays were employed to analyze soil samples for 19 enteropathogens, along with a selective bacterial culture for pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. An observational assessment was conducted during every site visit to document the hygienic infrastructure and sanitation conditions at the sites. We detected at least one pathogen in 79% (127/160) and ≥2 pathogens in 67.5% (108/160) of the soil samples tested. The four most frequently detected pathogens were EAEC (67.5%), ETEC (59%), EPEC (57.5%), and STEC (31%). The detection rate (91% vs. 66%) and mean number of enteric pathogens (5 vs. 4.7) were higher in low-income Kibera than in middle-income Jericho. The more extensive spatial distribution of pathogens in Kibera resulted in increases in the detection of different enteric pathogens from within-site (area < 50 m(2)) and across-site (across-neighborhood) movements compared to Jericho. The pathogen detection rates fluctuated seasonally in Jericho but remained at sustained high levels in Kibera. While better neighborhood conditions were linked with lower pathogen detection rates, pathogenic E. coli remained prevalent in the public environment across both neighborhoods. Future studies should focus on identifying how the sources of pathogen contamination are modified by improved environmental sanitation and hygiene and the role of these contaminated public environments in enteric infections in children.},

  abstract  = {Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death among children under five in developing communities, despite active interventions to improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene resources. Even interventions with high fidelity and compliance saw minimal improvements in health outcomes, necessitating a need for looking beyond traditionally targeted exposure pathways. This study focuses on the pathogen exposure a young child may receive while playing in the public spaces of informal settlements, where animal feces, human feces, and garbage are frequently observed. The study utilized 79 soil samples previously collected across ten cluster sites in Corail, Haiti and processed using DelAgua cultural assays and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction methods. Molecular assays screened for Aeromonas, Vibrio cholera, and several pathogenic Escherichia coli species. Behavioral observations of young children (<5 years old) were also conducted in overlapping areas with the environmental sampling to quantify frequency of risky and mitigating behaviors. Environmental and behavioral data were combined to obtain the posterior distribution of children’s pathogen exposure from playing in a public space for one hour. The model estimated that children have a likelihood of approximately 70% of being exposed to a pathogen during one hour of play and a greater than 30% chance of being exposed to multiple pathogens in the same period. While children and toddlers practice fewer risky behaviors compared to infants, they were shown to have higher likelihood of exposure and slightly higher pathogen dose per exposure. As anticipated, a high correlation between genes from the same E. coli species was observed in the model output. These findings demonstrate the need to consider public spaces as an important exposure pathway for young children for both future research and interventions.},
